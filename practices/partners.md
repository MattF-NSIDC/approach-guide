We work with really thoughtful partners that promote open science and kinder science. We are grateful to have so many different partners and types of partners supporting Openscapes. 

Partners can invest in Openscapes in different ways. 

Some provide funding to sponsor Champions Cohorts for their own communities or for open calls. 

Others provide paid time to assist Champions Cohorts, thereby developing themselves as Openscapes Mentors to lead future Cohorts within their own communities. Having this assistance and mentorship development be part of people's jobs is something important to us: this not only builds long-term capacity and resilience for kinder/open data science within other groups, but it also makes visible and values the labor and expertise that goes into open science, training, and community building.
