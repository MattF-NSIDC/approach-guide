We work with really thoughtful partners that promote open science and kinder science. We are grateful to have so many different partners and types of partners supporting Openscapes. 

Partners can invest in Openscapes in different ways. 

Some provide funding to sponsor Champions Cohorts for their own communities or for open calls. 

<!---*in development, please iterate!* We are interested in not only leading the Champions Program for their communities but also developing Champions Program Mentors within their communities â€” our plan for scaling Openscapes is for more people to be able to lead the program as part of their paid jobs. Examples: NASA, SASI. 
We work with these partners to develop a scope of work, whether that is delivering a 2-month Champions Cohort, investing in additional curriculm for a 4-month Champions Cohort, or a longer term --->

Others provide paid time to assist Champions Cohorts, thereby developing themselves as Openscapes Mentors to lead future Cohorts within their own communities. Having this assistance and mentorship development be part of people's jobs is something important to us: this not only builds long-term capacity and resilience for kinder/open data science within other groups, but it also makes visible and values the labor and expertise that goes into open science, training, and community building.
