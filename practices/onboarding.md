title: Onboarding
---

## Welcome to the team! 

As we start collaborating with folks to deliver the Champions Program we will be documenting the onboarding process here. We are onboarding folks to collaborate in different capacities — i.e. as mentors, evaluators, lesson contributors — so we will be trying to be as streamlined as possible with the most relevant information and skill-building to meet specific needs and timeframes. We are excited for more communities to be able to use the Openscapes approach. 

## First Introductions

To first get a sense of Openscapes, we recommend looking through [openscapes.org](https://openscapes.org), including looking at a few blogs and slide decks.

## Experience a Cohort Call

The next step for onboarding is to experience the Cohort Calls to see what they are really like. We'll give you access to an example folder of [Openscapes_CohortCalls](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JaQ3Dkrr7pUfesSaxqRqntGlxG0dz2nl?usp=sharing). The folder has four 1.5-hour videos and associated agendas, as well as the drafted blog post. We suggest you: 

- Read the blog post to get an overview
- Watch `04_CallRecording` while reading through `04_CallAgenda`. We use the Agendas for live note-taking but don’t screenshare it; you’ll hear us orient you to page numbers and sections as we go
- Look through a few examples in the `PathwaysShare` folder (linked from the `04_CallAgenda`)
- If you have time, also go through `01_CallRecording` and `01_CallAgenda`

## Cohort Assistants
### Seaside Chats

Our first few Seaside Chats together will focus on onboarding. We expect this to look like: 

1. **Getting oriented**: discuss Cohort Calls, pre-Cohort engagement & setup, tooling
    - cohort dates/calendar
    - add to Slack
1. **GitHub Clinic**: using GitHub to collaborate and publish from the web
1. **RMarkdown/Quarto Clinic**: how to contribute to the approach-guide and events site
