## Cohort Assistants

Welcome to the team! 

The following chapters in this book describe operations in more detail. But the first step for onboarding is to experience the Cohort Calls to see what they are really like. We'll give you access to an example folder of [Openscapes_CohortCalls](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JaQ3Dkrr7pUfesSaxqRqntGlxG0dz2nl?usp=sharing). The folder has four 1.5-hour videos and associated agendas, as well as the drafted blog post. We suggest you: 

- Read the blog post to get an overview
- Watch `04_CallRecording` while reading through `04_CallAgenda`. We use the Agendas for live note-taking but don’t screenshare it; you’ll hear us orient you to page numbers and sections as we go
- Look through a few examples in the `PathwaysShare` folder (linked from the `04_CallAgenda`)
- If you have time, also go through `01_CallRecording` and `01_CallAgenda`
