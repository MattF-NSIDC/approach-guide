This is how we onboard. 

Build skills as we go. Build shared skillsets in part through Seaside Chats. Tooling is next. [MORE!]

## Cohort Assistants

Welcome to the team! 

The following chapters in this book describe operations in more detail. Here we describe what onboarding will look like. 

### Experience a Cohort Call

The first step for onboarding is to experience the Cohort Calls to see what they are really like. We'll give you access to an example folder of [Openscapes_CohortCalls](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JaQ3Dkrr7pUfesSaxqRqntGlxG0dz2nl?usp=sharing). The folder has four 1.5-hour videos and associated agendas, as well as the drafted blog post. We suggest you: 

- Read the blog post to get an overview
- Watch `04_CallRecording` while reading through `04_CallAgenda`. We use the Agendas for live note-taking but don’t screenshare it; you’ll hear us orient you to page numbers and sections as we go
- Look through a few examples in the `PathwaysShare` folder (linked from the `04_CallAgenda`)
- If you have time, also go through `01_CallRecording` and `01_CallAgenda`

### Seaside Chats

Our first few Seaside Chats together will focus on onboarding. We expect this to look like: 

1. **Getting oriented**: discuss Cohort Calls, pre-Cohort engagement & setup, tooling
    - cohort dates/calendar
    - add to Slack
1. **GitHub Clinic**: using GitHub to collaborate and publish from the web
1. **RMarkdown/Quarto Clinic**: how to contribute to the approach-guide and events site
