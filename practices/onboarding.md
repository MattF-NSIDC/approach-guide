title: Onboarding
---

## Welcome to the team! 

As we start collaborating with folks to deliver the Champions Program we will be documenting the onboarding process here. We are onboarding folks to collaborate in different capacities — i.e. as mentors, assistants, evaluators, lesson contributors — so we will be trying to be as streamlined as possible with the most relevant information and skill-building to meet specific needs and timeframes. We are excited for more communities to be able to use the Openscapes approach! 

## First Introductions

To first get a sense of Openscapes, we recommend looking through [openscapes.org](https://openscapes.org), including some of the slides listed on the [approach](https://openscapes.org/approach) and [champions](https://openscapes.org/champions) pages. This will help give you an overview of Openscapes as a whole and of the Champions Program.

## Experience a Cohort Call

The next step is to experience the Cohort Calls to see what they are really like. We'll give you access to an example folder of [Openscapes_CohortCalls](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JaQ3Dkrr7pUfesSaxqRqntGlxG0dz2nl?usp=sharing). The folder has four 1.5-hour videos and associated agendas, as well as the drafted blog post. We suggest you: 

- Read the blog post to get an overview
- Watch `04_CallRecording` while at the same time reading through `04_CallAgenda`. We use the Agendas for live note-taking but don’t screenshare it; you’ll hear us orient you to page numbers and sections as we go
- Look through a few examples in the `PathwaysShare` folder (linked from the `04_CallAgenda`)
- If you have time, also go through `01_CallRecording` and `01_CallAgenda`

## Seaside Chats

We'll then meet for a Seaside Chat to get oriented and establish a workplan. We expect this to look like the following for different collaborators.  

### Lesson Contributors

1. **Getting oriented**: discuss Cohort Calls, lesson structure, brainstorm lesson plan
    - cohort dates/calendar
    - add to Slack
1. **Lesson workplan**: solidify lesson plan, establish workplan/co-working

### Cohort Assistants

1. **Getting oriented**: discuss Cohort Calls, pre-Cohort engagement & setup, tooling
    - cohort dates/calendar
    - add to Slack
1. **GitHub Clinic**: using GitHub to collaborate and publish from the web
1. **RMarkdown/Quarto Clinic**: how to contribute to the approach-guide and events site
