title: "Tooling"
---

We try to use a few amount of tools that interoperate well. We also explore and learn new tools but always always with an eye towards interoperability with our current tools, and with an understanding of how the open science community and environmental/Earth science communities are working.

We use these main tools:

- Google Drive
  - Drive
  - Calendar

- GitHub
  - version control for everything that's not Google Drive
  - coordination with Issues
  - publishing all our R-based web communications (see next)
  - comms through website

- R/RStudio
  - data analysis (R: tidyverse, RMarkdown)
  - communications and technical writing (RMarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, Quarto)

-   Slack

-   Zoom

- ORCID/Rescognito?

- Airtable
