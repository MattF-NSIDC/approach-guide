Openscapes is part of the open science movement and supported and inspired by the many diverse communities and efforts working for more inclusive and kinder research culture.

This Approach Guide document is inspired from <https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/index.html>, <https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook>, <https://2i2c.org/team-compass/>, and others.

Our [**Resources**](https://www.openscapes.org/resources) page has some resources meant to welcome environmental scientists who are newly onboarding to open data science. We also have a public [Openscapes Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4118402/openscapes/library) linking publications, talks, and curricula. Our [Openscapes GitHub Organization](https://github.com/openscapes) has pinned repositories of interest, including the [teaching-learning-resources](https://github.com/openscapes/teaching-learning-resources) repo where we use [Issues](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/[teaching-learning-resources](https://github.com/openscapes/teaching-learning-resources/issues)) to jot down specific tools or learning resources for open, reproducible, inclusive science.
