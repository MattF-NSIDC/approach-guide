**Welcome to the Openscapes Approach Guide!** This is an open and iterating guide to onboard folks to the Openscapes approach. 

## About Openscapes

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is an approach for doing better science in less time.** We offer mentorship, training, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science: we help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind. 

**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.** We support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skillsets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science. 

## About This Guide

We've been growing Openscapes since founding it in 2018. This is our attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others as we grow. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly, and designing it so that others could use it on their own too. We encourage anyone to use and "fork" it to make it your own (particularly when it's a bit more developed!). 

We complete a full revolution of our [Flywheel](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) each time we lead the Champions Program.

Each turn of the flywheel delivers the Champions program for a Cohort of research teams so that they can begin transforming their workflows towards kinder, inclusive open science and inspire their broader communities. We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn and to meet specific Cohort needs, and attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork. 

This book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus with developing mentors and delivering the Champions Program. 


### Built with Quarto

We're collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto: <https://quarto.org>. Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown, which we use for all Openscapes websites, blogs, and more. Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered natively using Jupyter and Knitr engines.
