This is the Openscapes Approach Guide! It is an open and iterating resource to welcome more people to the Openscapes approach. 

## About Openscapes

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is an approach for doing better science in less time.** We offer mentorship, training, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science: we help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind. 

**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.** We support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skillsets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science. 

## About This Guide

We have been growing Openscapes since founding it in 2018. This site is our attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others as we grow, so its ongoing development will focus on our immediate needs. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are writing it openly, and in a way that others can use it on their own. We encourage anyone to use and "fork" this guide to make it your own (particularly when it's a bit more developed!). 

We complete a full revolution of our Flywheel each time we lead the Champions Program. This book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus with developing mentors and delivering the Champions Program.
