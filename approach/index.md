title: "Openscapes Approach"
---

**We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science.** These are critical to uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards **kinder science.**

We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. There are many ways to practice open science and to welcome others to participate. We see data analysis and stewardship as powerful entryways for open science, and we meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skillsets and mindsets of immediate value while empowering them as leaders. We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate justice and get out the vote movements.
