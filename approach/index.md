## Openscapes Mindset and practice

**We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science.** These are critical to uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards **kinder science.**


We work openly and for Future Us.

Openscapes Mindset.

Growth Mindset. 

Continual learning â€” and practicing and iterating with that learning.

Psychological safety ([Edmundson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8)).

Kinder science. 

We use the same open source tools that teach.

## Calendar

Our [annual calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTmoarCD60VYs-wWfdJidiTo_Q-nz3APS6zWofkFT07apAXRRwrAMaF5i982CnTbj7bhjspVPU8QsgW/pubhtml?gid=372699314&single=true) shows that we lead Champions Cohorts in two periods per year, including an open call in the spring. This gives us time to annually review lessons and programming and take time off in the summer.
