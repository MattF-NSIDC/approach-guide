title: "Tooling"
---

We try to use a few amount of tools that interoperate well and are open source and collaborative.

We also explore and learn new tools but always always with an eye towards interoperability with our current tooling, and with an understanding of how the open science community and environmental/Earth science communities are working.

Below are the tools that we use, why we use them, and set up instructions and [notes](https://github.com/Openscapes/teaching-learning-resources/issues/12).
