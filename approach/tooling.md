title: "Tooling"
---

We try to use a few tools that interoperate well and are open source and collaborative.

We also explore and learn new tools but always always with an eye towards interoperability with our current tooling, and with an understanding of how the open science community and environmental/Earth science communities are working.

Below are the tools that we use, why we use them, and set up instructions. (Here are some [Macbook setup notes](https://github.com/Openscapes/teaching-learning-resources/issues/12)).

### Google Workspace

We use an Openscapes Google Workspace. This is our default system for Champions Cohorts, however, we have adapted when required to use MS Teams / Sharepoint.

-   Calendar
-   Drive
-   Docs
-   Sheets

We prefer to use Zoom over Google Meet, which we found has some limits to functionality e.g. breakout rooms

### GitHub

-   version control for everything that's not Google Drive
-   coordination with Issues and GitHub Projects
-   publishing all our R-based web communications (see next)
-   comms through website

### R/RStudio

-   all websites and books
-   data analysis (R: tidyverse, RMarkdown)
-   communications and technical writing (RMarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, Quarto)
-   [RStudio and GitHub setup instructions](https://openscapes.github.io/series/how-to/setup-rstudio-github.html)

### Slack

We use Slack as a way to build community by hosting a space for people to connect with each other around Openscapes-relevant topics. Members include people who have participated in a Champions Program, Pathways to Open Science, or other Openscapes program.

#### Channel definitions

These are meant to help people know where to post or ask questions. These definitions are listed in the Slack channel Topic and Description (because the Topic preview is visible in the channel, while the Description is not).

When people join, they automatically land in #welcome #general #seaside-chats #events #cool-finds #shared-joy #random.

**#welcome**: A place for people new to our community to introduce themselves and for the rest of us to make them feel welcome; the default channel that members cannot leave if they leave all other channels

**#general**: Openscapes team posts Openscapes announcements

**#seaside-chats**: A place to discuss ongoing progress. Friendly Q & A about good enough practices, team culture, tools ...

**#events**: Events that might be of interest to others in our community. Openscapes events go in #general

**#cool-finds**: Posts, datasets, podcasts, repos, papers, videos, packages, ...things you found that are cool

**#jobs**: Job opportunities, seeking work, offers to connect people with those "on the inside"

**#shared-joy**: Sharing joy of any shape or size

**#random**: Non-work banter and water cooler conversation

## Example email Slack invitation

*revise to include invitation link in body of email, not as followup email coming from inside Slack, but hide link when this is copied to public GitHub Issue*

Subject: Openscapes invitation to Slack

You'll soon receive an email-invitation to join Openscapes Slack as a way to connect with other Openscapes Champions. You will automatically land in several channels plus a private nmfs-champions channel that includes people from all 4 NMFS Fall 2022 Cohorts. People are invariably friendly and open to asking and answering questions. You can get a feel for how things work by "listening" to the discussions.

When you join, you'll automatically land in #welcome #cool-finds #events #general #random #seaside-chats #shared-joy. You can browse other channels and choose to join them (click 3 dots beside Channels \> Browse channels).

The #welcome channel is a place for new members to introduce themselves and for the rest of us to help them feel welcome by adding an emoji or saying "I work on sea turtles too!". Short read on [The Value of #Welcome](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/07/18/value-of-welcome/).

New to Slack? There are both technical and etiquette aspects to getting comfortable. For technical tips see [Getting started for new members](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members) and [How to use Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide). This Slack [quick start guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3763729) from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement includes 1) configuring your account; 2) channels and notifications; 3) communicating.
