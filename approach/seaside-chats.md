This is all (some of?) the way we work together

## Seaside Chats

We build shared skillsets in part through Seaside Chats. [Seaside Chats](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) are regular meetings where we skillshare and learn together. This will likely be the avenue for onboarding. That will be a place where you can get familiar with any of the tooling and practices that we use. And, you can teach the rest of the team what you know so that we can all work better together.

## Co-working

We also have [co-working sessions](https://www.cscce.org/2020/02/04/online-co-working-partnerships-are-community-of-practice-in-action/) where we work at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves screensharing to problem solve. 

## Hackathons

We have hackathons to tackle specific tasks together. These are often a good way to get early momentum on a project or to re-invigorate an existing project. We kick-started this guide during a hackathon! We made chapter headings to outline the guide and built and iterated as we went.

## Community Calls

We have 4 Community Calls per year where we discuss and explore topics relevant to Openscapes.
