## Champions Program Design

The Champions Program is described at <https://openscapes.org> and is taught with the [Champions Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/), which are open educational resources.

Here are a few example presentations to introduce the Champions program with different audiences, including sharing with leadership and to recruit participants:

## High-level timeline

We work with our Partners to plan Champions Cohorts. 

This includes coordinating within the partner community, scheduling dates, and preparing the engagement strategy to share the opportunity and attract research teams interested in better practices for their research.

1. [**Cohort Planning**](/champions/cohort-planning.md) with partners: 2-5 months prior to Cohort start date.
1. [**Pre-Cohort Engagement**](/champions/pre-cohort-engage.qmd) with potential participants: ~2 months prior to Cohort start date. 
1. [**Leading Cohort Calls**](/champions/leading-cohort-calls.qmd) for participants: 2 months.

Here is an example timeline that includes Pre-program engagement, Openscapes Champions Program, and Post-program follow-up, visualized by Anna Holder and Corey Clatterbuck for the California Waterboards Cohort.
