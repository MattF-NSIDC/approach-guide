## Operations overview
*The following can be built into a statement of work with our Partners.* 

### Summary and Scope

The Openscapes team will lead a 2- or 4 month Champions Cohot: a remote workshop series for a cohort of research teams.. The cohort of 6-8 teams (up to 40 participants; ~4 individuals/team) meets twice monthly over 2 or 4 months for 1.5-hour video calls. These small-time requirements over longer time frames enable incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientistsâ€™ busy schedules and varying expertise and needs.

The goals of the Champions workshop series are to help teams normalize data discussions, identify shared needs and how to address them, and how to think ahead so they can more effectively onboard themselves and others onto new (and existing) projects.

**Workshop goals include:**

- Create leaders within a research community to champion open science best practices 
- Help participants adopt open science tooling and practices, including reproducibility, openness, collaboration, inclusion, share methods sooner 
- Participants build trust and community within and across teams (across career stages)
- Participants are more confident sharing imperfect work within their teams and cohort
- Participants become champions for open science and part of the bigger open science movement

### Services

Openscapes will provide the curriculum, agendas, and lead the remote workshop series. The curriculum will be based on the lesson series available at: <https://openscapes.org/series>. 

1. Openscapes mindset, Better science in less time
1. Team culture, Technical strategies for future us
1. Coding communities, Research examples
1. Sharing Pathways forward

Additionally, we lead: 

- GitHub Clinics for hands-on team skill-building
- Community engagement leading up to, throughout, and after the Cohort
 
Openscapes will co-create recruiting materials (e.g., openscapes.org/events), and will lightly email participants preceding, throughout, and following the workshop. The Openscapes team will provide curriculum, support coordination, and teach the remote workshop series along with workshop helpers.
