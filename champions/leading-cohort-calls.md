title: "Leading Cohort Calls"
format: html

Everyone on the Openscapes team should be a confident leader and active contributor during Cohort Calls. This is how we lead each call, with additional steps for the first call.

## Roles

There are three main roles when we lead Cohort Calls. When folks are assisting a Cohort Call, they often help take notes, and monitor chat, and create breakout rooms.

-   **Tech Host**: Zoom co-host, create breakout groups, monitor chat & Slack, help note-taking
-   **Facilitator**: Leads discussion as noted in the Agenda
-   **Teacher**: Talks through demos and slides

## Before each Cohort Call

Prepare the Agenda; see [Agenda Setup](/champions/pre-cohort-tech.md#agenda-setup).

## During Cohort Calls

-   Welcome folks as they join, ask them to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team (helps us for breakout groups)
-   monitor the chat
-   help with note-taking. Both to capture what folks are saying and to role-model. Help other engage.

## Example chat welcome text

Welcome! Please write your name in Roll Call as you join: \[ doc \]

**If you need access to the doc please put your email in chat**

And please rename yourself with how you'd like to be called and your team name (hover over your name or video \> 3 dots \> Rename)
:::

## Between Cohort Calls

Between Calls there are tasks for the Openscapes team and for the Champions teams.

## Digests

We send digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday) via GitHub Issues.

Digests include links to the Call's agenda, the Call's goals, slides, and some excerpts from the shared notes.

See examples:

Set up Slack Channel with all assistants

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example slack text: team coordination

Hi All, Excited for today! We'll share the \[ Agenda \] in chat, and expect that some folks will still need to request access. We'll ask them to share their emails in chat so that we can add them quickly - to the folder if possible. If you add access for someone, would you also add their email to \[ OpenscapesParticipants \] and I'll revisit afterwards. Thanks!

### Afterwards

**Slack invites**

-   Create a private Slack channel for the Cohort, invite everyone to the Org and private channel
-   Write a welcome message in the general or welcome channel
