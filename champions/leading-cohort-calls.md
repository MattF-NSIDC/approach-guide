Everyone on the Openscapes team should be a confident leader and active contributor during Cohort Calls. 

## Roles

There are three main roles when we lead Cohort Calls. When folks are assisting a Cohort Call, they often help take notes, and monitor chat, and create breakout rooms.

-   **Tech Host**: Zoom co-host, create breakout groups, monitor chat, help note-taking
-   **Facilitator**: Leads discussion as noted in the Agenda
-   **Teacher**: Talks through demos and slides

## Before each Cohort Call

Prepare the Agenda; see [Agenda Setup](/champions/pre-cohort-tech.md#agenda-setup).

## During Cohort Calls

- Welcome folks as they join, ask them to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team (helps us for breakout groups)
- monitor the chat
- help with note-taking. Both to capture what folks are saying and to role-model. Help other engage.

## Between Cohort Calls

Between Calls there are tasks for the Openscapes team and for the Champions teams.

## Digests

We send digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday) via GitHub Issues. 

Digests include links to the Call's agenda, the Call's goals, slides, and some excerpts from the shared notes.
