After all the pre-cohort engagement and tech setup, it's time to lead Cohort Calls. 

## Roles

There are three main roles when we lead Cohort Calls. When folks are assisting a Cohort Call, they often help take notes, and monitor chat, and create breakout rooms.

-   **Tech Host**: Zoom co-host, create breakout groups, monitor chat, help note-taking
-   **Facilitator**: Leads discussion as noted in the Agenda
-   **Teacher**: Talks through demos and slides

## Before each Cohort Call

Prepare the Agenda; see pre-cohort-tech.

## During Cohort Calls

- Welcome folks as they join, ask them to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team (helps us for breakout groups)
- monitor the chat
- help with note-taking. Both to capture what folks are saying and to role-model. Help other engage.
