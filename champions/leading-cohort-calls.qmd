title: "Leading Cohort Calls"
format: html
---

Everyone on the Openscapes team should be a confident leader and active contributor during Cohort Calls. This is how we lead each call, with additional steps for the first call.

## Roles

There are three main roles when we lead Cohort Calls. When folks are assisting a Cohort Call, they often help take notes, and monitor chat, and create breakout rooms. 

-   **Tech Host**: Zoom co-host, create breakout groups, monitor chat & Slack, help note-taking
-   **Facilitator**: Zoom co-host, leads discussion as noted in the Agenda
-   **Teacher**: Talks through demos and slides

Note-taking should focus on capturing questions and conversations and less about slides. Copying questions from the Chat into the Agenda is also really helpful. 

- Example Roles: [NOAA NMFS](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues/1)

## Before Cohort Calls

- Prepare the Agenda; see [Agenda Setup](#agenda-setup) next
- Review Roles, with particular focus on facilitator and tech host roles

### Agenda setup {#agenda-setup}

[Blank agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1II5YXUK_iuV7fXelcUV49RPAXxI7fveJ?usp=sharing) are in a public Google Folder. Before each Cohort Call, we:

-   Make a copy
-   Save it in the Cohort Google Folder
-   Edit dates, times, add Google Folder links and Zoom links
-   Review and tailor for Cohort and Facilitator (including Land Acknowledgement)

We usually do this before each Cohort Call (as opposed to all at once at the beginning) as a way for us to review/prepare for each Cohort Call and so to reduce confusion for participants.


## During Cohort Calls

Software to have open: 

- Zoom
- Slack for back-channeling if needed, likely not 
- Agenda
- Quicklinks Issue, Participants List (example: [NOAA NMFS](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues/1))
-   Welcome folks as they join, ask them to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team (helps us for breakout groups)
-   Monitor the chat
-   Help with note-taking. Both to capture what folks are saying and to role-model. Help others engage.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example chat welcome text

Welcome! Please write your name in Roll Call as you join: \[ doc \]

**If you need access to the doc please put your email in chat**

And please rename yourself with how you'd like to be called and your team name (hover over your name or video \> 3 dots \> Rename)
:::

### Guest teachers' presentations

Screenshare! This way we can edit out the recording if groups would like to share these presentations publicly, for example with NOAA NMFS' Em Markowitz' [Data to Product Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyqOjQwQLy8).

## Between Cohort Calls

Between Calls there are tasks for the Openscapes team and for the Champions teams (that the Openscapes team helps support).

### Field Notes

We ask all co-leads and assistants to write down thoughts about how the cohort went - these are internal "field notes" that will help us improve between Cohort Calls and across Cohorts. 

Prompts to answer include: 

- Top-of-mind
- Brief summary of how it went
- Rose / Bud / Thorn - something that was good, developing, or tricky

Write field notes in the Planning Docs, at the bottom

### Digests

We send digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday) via GitHub Issues.

Digests include links to the Call's agenda, the Call's goals, slides, and some excerpts from the shared notes.

We develop these in the Openscapes [cohort-planning](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues?q=+label%3Adigest+) repo. 

See examples:

-   [01 Call Digest \[ CSS \]](https://github.com/Openscapes/css-cohort/issues/18)
-   [02 Call Digest \[ CSS \]](https://github.com/Openscapes/css-cohort/issues/15)
-   [03 Call Digest \[ CSS \]](https://github.com/Openscapes/css-cohort/issues/17)
-   [04 Call Digest \[ CSS \]](https://github.com/Openscapes/css-cohort/issues/19)

### Co-working

This is something we've just started with the Cohorts fall 2021 and they are going well. It's a nice practice that our team does together (to work on your own but have a buddy available over Zoom) and it's nice to offer as a practice to the Champions too.  

We set up an hour of Co-Working in between weeks; these are optional times where folks can work on their own things but also share and ask questions. Read more about co-working ([Butland & Penfold 2020](https://www.cscce.org/2020/02/04/online-co-working-partnerships-are-community-of-practice-in-action/)). Here is an [example agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kaMqhEIpF5flepHLS2TD3z2gSvSY5rzGOgC7IXCi-Dg/edit#). 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example Co-working agenda
We share what we're going to work on, and then work quietly and then check in at the end as well. We also make breakout rooms for Q&A if folks want to screenshare and talk things out.

- Brief intros to share what weâ€™re planning to work on
- Create breakout rooms based on topics, and you can move yourself. Today: 
    - ProjectBoards
    - ChattierRoom - Eli there for Q&A. Pop in and out. 
- Brief closing to share what you did & any resources!

### Seaside Chats

Champions teams will hold Seaside Chats, and we share suggested topics each Cohort Call.

## First Cohort Call

The first Cohort Call has additional setup and followup, since we introduce and follow up on things that we discuss together (i.e. Slack)

### Beforehand

Set up Slack Channel with all assistants

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example slack text: team coordination

Hi All, Excited for today! We'll share the \[ Agenda \] in chat, and expect that some folks will still need to request access. We'll ask them to share their emails in chat so that we can add them quickly - to the folder if possible. If you add access for someone, would you also add their email to \[ OpenscapesParticipants \] and I'll revisit afterwards. Thanks!
:::

### Afterwards

**Slack invites**

-   Create a private Slack channel for the Cohort, invite everyone to the Org and private channel
-   Write a welcome message in the general or welcome channel

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
Hi Everyone - We have a new Champions Cohort that started today and we just added them to slack! They may say hello here too :wave: Here is their [ cohort repo ] with a few more details. 
:::

### GitHub Clinic Invites

Send Calendar Invites for the GitHub Clinics:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example Google Calendar Description text: GitHub Clinic

GitHub Clinics that can serve as your first Seaside Chat. We'll cover how to use GitHub collaboratively from the browser: focused on publishing and project management.

There are 2 options and 2 calendar invites; please accept a time that works for you and we'll share the recording as well if your team will meet independently for your first Seaside Chat.
:::

Slack reminder: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example Slack reminder text: GitHub Clinic
Hi \@channel! Today's GitHub Clinic is in 3 hours (12pm PT, [ zoom link ])! For folks who've already provided their github usernames, please check your email to accept the invitation from GitHub for the repository. And for folks who haven't yet shared/created a GitHub username, there is still time! Create an account at GitHub.com and share your username here in slack or in the [ participant spreadsheet ]. Thanks!

:::

Create a Cohort copy of the [GitHub Clinic Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puf1UG7HVwZwnbfc0mlBIzCSGvc-99TcTOdmPHzqZc4/edit#heading=h.ypq91biaklid), save it in the Cohort's folder

## GitHub Clinic

**GitHub Clinic** are 1 hour long, and require at least two team members. *Some history: In 2021 we experimented having these as stand-alone events between Cohort Calls 1 and 2, offering them twice as well as the recording as part of team's Seaside Chats. In 2022 we'll re-instate the GitHub Clinic into Cohort Call 2, and increase the number of Cohort Calls to 5.* 

During the Clinic, the Tech Host will make breakout groups, either based on their actual research team or as a random breakout group, depending on whether they attend with their team. We use the Cohort's ParticipantsList spreadsheet to assist with identifying teams, and we also ask people to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team. 

The Facilitator leads the agenda, and Teacher talks through the slides and screenshares. 

Team members can also circulate in the breakout rooms to check in, help, and share.

Preparing for the GitHub Clinic involves: 

- making a copy of the [GitHub Clinic Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puf1UG7HVwZwnbfc0mlBIzCSGvc-99TcTOdmPHzqZc4/edit)
- adding participant GitHub usernames to the Cohort's repo
- reviewing the slides
