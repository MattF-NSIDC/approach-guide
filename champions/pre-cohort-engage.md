## Overview

Since 2018 we have iterated on a coordination strategy that works well for coordinating with partners and attracting research teams to participate in the Champions Cohort. This coordinating work begins \~2.5 months before the cohort will start, and the time allows for preparing text for communications (announcement emails, twitter, and website and google form), having a \~1 month long nomination period, selection, and 1:1 interviews with each team lead prior to the cohort starting.

We focus our engagement/recruitment of team leads (i.e. PIs) to coordinate for their teams.

We begin this planning once we've scheduled the dates, \~2 months before the Cohort begins: see the Timeline Chapter for details about timing.

## Planning document

We make a copy of our [Openscapes-CohortPlanningDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uzQ-hic0Kn0pNyeb9VwVNDwMYRetZgiXkQ2mZIe_TXk/edit?usp=sharing) to share with our Partners. This planning document is to help us finalize dates and text language for announcing and coordinating our Openscapes Cohort.

The following is a high-level overview of what is in the Planning Doc and announcement, with example text.

## Announcement: call for nominations

Once we finalize schedules and text in the CohortPlanningDoc, we announce the opportunity as ask team leads to nominate their teams.

### Email, Twitter, Fliers

Our partners will distribute the announcement via their channels through email, listeserves, fliers, etc. We can also tweet the announcement from our account (<https://twitter.com/openscapes>). All announcements will link to the opportunity's post on the Openscapes events page (see next).

### Openscapes events page

We create a post on the Openscapes Events page with details about the opportunity. This can be cross-posted elsewhere. It will be linked in any email correspondance, fliers, tweets, etc. Here is an example: <https://openscapes.github.io/events/posts/2021-05-07-css-champions>

## Program overview

**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for NOAA research groups to explore open data science practices.**

[**Openscapes**](https://openscapes.org) is an approach for doing better science in less time\[\^1\]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes' mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science\[\^2\], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

[**Openscapes Champions**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/) is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.

**This opportunity is funded by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).**

## Guest lecturers

We invite guest lecturers to present topics during Cohort Calls, either from our existing slides or they can contribute their own on a similar topic. For example, Dr. Jessica Couture contributed a new slide deck on metadata and presented this during the [data strategies for future us](https://openscapes.github.io/series/data-strategies.html) lesson. Most of our guest lecturers are Champions from previous cohorts (Jessica is a Champion from the 2019-inaugural cohort), and we are able to offer an honorium for their time and expertise.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example email to guest lecturer

Hi \[ potential guest lecturer\],

How are you? I hope you've had a break this summer and are doing ok with everything going on.

Openscapes a few Champions cohorts we're leading this fall, including one with researchers using fisheries dependent data in the US Northeast coordinated by Gavin Fay, Andy Jones, and Rachel Baum (here's the [cohort page](https://openscapes.github.io/2021-fdd/)).

We wanted to see if you'd be interested in guest lecturing at one of these Cohort Calls for 20-25 minutes, presenting \~12 mins of slides and leading the following discussion (likely breakout groups and then group discussion). We're thinking of you joining the second call and presenting about [data strategies for future us](https://openscapes.github.io/series/data-strategies.html), or the third and presenting about [coding strategies for future us](https://openscapes.github.io/series/coding-strategies.html). You could either present from our existing slide decks, or present something on-theme from your work, and we can help you with the format and timing. Cohort Calls 2 & 3 are on October 1 & 15 from 12-1:30pm ET (exact time TBD but you're welcome to just attend for your part). We are able to offer an honorarium as well.

We're excited to hear your ideas, and if this isn't the right thing now to think about if there's another way we can involve you in the future if you'd like. We'd love to chat with you about it in any case, would you be able to suggest a few times for a 30-minute call?

Cheers,

Julie and Erin

## Cohort welcome

### Week prior

\~1 week prior to the beginning of the Cohort, we email the full Cohort, welcoming everyone and sharing the plan and a few action items. This includes providing an email address that can access Google Drive and their GitHub username!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example email to welcome cohort: week prior
Hello All, 

We are so excited to welcome you to the 2021 SASI Openscapes Champions Cohort! Our first Cohort Call is in one week on September 9 and we wanted to share some information with you.

**Plan.**

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is an approach for doing better science in less time. We help research groups reimagine data-intensive science, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Our Cohort is supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's [Symbiosis in Aquatic Systems Initiative (SASI)](https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=symbiosis-in-aquatic-systems-initiative), and we’re partnering with [protocols.io](https://protocols.io), a secure platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. 

**Cohort Logistics.**

Details and short intros of participating labs are at[ https://openscapes.github.io/2021-sasi](https://openscapes.github.io/2021-sasi). We pulled intros from your websites; if you have edits please do so through GitHub – and if you don’t yet know how to do this, you’ll learn in our GitHub Clinic after Call 1!

**Before Sept 9, please**:

1. **Check that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links** for our 8 Cohort Calls starting Sept 9. If you have not received these invites, please let us know. 
2. **Complete your information in OpenscapesParticipants [ 2021-sasi ]** to make sure you can access the software we’ll use (Google Drive and GitHub).
3. **Read [Lowndes et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)**: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. Optionally, you can also review the slides/video of a [recent plenary](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/08/01/sortee-plenary/).

**Additional Information.**

All Openscapes events abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct).

Will be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know.

Schedule “Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “[Seaside Chats](https://github.com/Openscapes/seaside-chats)” and suggest you schedule them with your team now (PIs do not need to attend).

The Champions Program is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate.

**Meet the Openscapes team.**

We’re the team you’ll see most often on the calls, along with a few guest speakers:

* [Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.cio), Openscapes founder and co-director, NCEAS, UCSB
* [Erin Robinson](http://erinrobinson.net/), Openscapes co-director, Metadata Game Changers
* [Lenny Teytelman](https://www.protocols.io/researchers/lenny-teytelman8), protocols.io founder and CEO
* [Emma Ganley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eganley/), protocols.io Director of Strategic Initiatives

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we’re looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort. 

Cheers,

Julie, Erin, Lenny, and Emma
