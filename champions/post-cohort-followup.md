Hi [Name],

Thank you for presenting at the Openscapes Champions Cohort Series on [June 25, 2021]. 

In appreciation of your time spent preparing and presenting at our event, we are able to provide a $150 stipend. I've attached two forms here that UCSB needs in order to process this for you. Please send them back to me and let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you very much, 
Cheers,
Julie
