Between Calls there are tasks for the Openscapes team and for the Champions teams.

## Digests

We send digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday) via GitHub Issues. 

Digests include links to the Call's agenda, the Call's goals, slides, and some excerpts from the shared notes. 

See examples: 

- [01 Call Digest [ CSS ] ](https://github.com/Openscapes/css-cohort/issues/18)
- [02 Call Digest [ CSS ] ](https://github.com/Openscapes/css-cohort/issues/15)
