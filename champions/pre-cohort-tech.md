*Could also be titled: pre-cohort tech?*

## Overview

Here is the tech setup that we do one time per Cohort. Some things we do before the first Cohort Call (i.e. Google Folder) and some after the first Cohort Call (i.e. Slack). We'll schedule GitHub Clinics prior to the second Cohort Call. 

*Note: we are working to automate our tech setup for each cohort üòç This work will eventually be in an `openscapesr` R package, stay tuned.* 

## Data entry

As teams form, we: 

- Update with who is in which cohort, whether we've added them to the calendars and twitter, etc. 

They will s

## Cohort Google Folder

Prior to the first Cohort Call, we: 

- Create a Google Folder with the name of the cohort in brackets, e.g. `2021-noaa-nwfsc`
- Add all Cohort emails (note: some participants will provide a gmail address if their univerity email isn't gmail; add this address as well)
- Add a Pathways folder

## Agendas

[Blank agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1II5YXUK_iuV7fXelcUV49RPAXxI7fveJ?usp=sharing) are in a public Google Folder. Before each Cohort Call, we:

- Make a copy
- Save it in the Cohort Google Folder
- Edit dates, times, add Google Folder links and Zoom links
- Review and tailor for Cohort and Facilitator (including Land Acknowledgement)

We usually do this before each Cohort Call (as opposed to all at once at the beginning) as a way for us to review/prepare for each Cohort Call and so to reduce confusion for participants. See 

### Agenda structure

Cohort Calls are 1 hour 30 minutes. Each Call is different, but they have this core structure: 

- Roll call with ice breaker
- Welcome with Code of Conduct reminder
- Slides with activity 1
- Slides with activity 2
- Efficiency tip

Activities include prompted silent journaling or breakout groups followed by group discussion. Breakout groups are 3-4 people each; some are random, some group by team, and some group leads together and members together.

## GitHub repo

Prior to the GitHub Clinic, we: 

- Create a Cohort GitHub repo within the Openscapes GitHub organization.
- Make it a gh-pages repo
- Add all usernames with admin privileges (ask for usernames prior to Clinic)
- Create each person's files for the Clinic
- Add a Code of Coduct
- Write Cohort info on the README
- *Add Evaluation information*

Example: <https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-nwfsc-cohort-2>

## Slack

After the first Cohort Call, we:

- Create a private Slack channel for the cohort 
Invite everyone to Slack

## Airtable
