*Could also be titled: pre-cohort tech?*

## Overview

Here is the tech setup that we do one time per Cohort. Some things we do before the first Cohort Call (i.e. Google Folder) and some after the first Cohort Call (i.e. Slack). We'll schedule GitHub Clinics prior to the second Cohort Call. 

*Note: we are working to automate our tech setup for each cohort üòç This work will eventually be in an `openscapesr` R package, stay tuned.*

Prior to the first Cohort Call, we:

- Add 01_CallAgenda updated for the cohort (detailed in @sec-before-cohort)
