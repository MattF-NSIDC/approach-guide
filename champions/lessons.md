## Lesson Series

The [Openscapes Champions Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/) describe the lessons we currently teach, with each lesson represented as a book chapter with linked slides. We teach from the slides and not from the book chapters; the chapters will ultimately be a stand-alone resource for self-paced learning. The welcome page also has a table of Cohort Agendas, with our core lessons for two-month Cohorts: 


Our lessons are taught during Cohort Calls followed by an activity (see details about [agenda structure](/champions/pre-cohort-tech.html#agenda-structure)). Each lesson is a 10-15 minute slide deck or demo, and there are two lessons per Cohort Call. 




We review our planned lessons before we teach, there are new examples and features that we add to the [lesson series book](https://openscapes.github.io/series) and the associated slides.
