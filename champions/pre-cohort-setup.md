*Could also be titled: pre-cohort tech?*

Note: we are working to automate our tech setup for each cohort. This work will eventually be in an `openscapesr` R package, stay tuned. 

Here is the tech setup involved

## Data entry

Keep coordinated with who is in which cohort, whether we've added them to the calendars and twitter, etc. 

## Google Folder

Prior to the first Cohort Call, we: 

- Create a Google Folder
- Add all Cohort emails (note: some participants will provide a gmail address if their univerity email isn't gmail; add this address as well)
- Add a Pathways folder
- Add 01_CallAgenda updated for the cohort

## GitHub repo

Prior to the GitHub Clinic, we: 

- Create a Cohort GitHub repo within the Openscapes GitHub organization.
- Add all usernames with admin privileges (ask for usernames prior to Clinic)
- Create each person's files for the Clinic

## Slack

After the first Cohort Call, we:

- Create a private Slack channel for the cohort 
Invite everyone to Slack

## Airtable

(upcoming?)
