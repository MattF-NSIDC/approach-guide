**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.**
We support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a
collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value
to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research
communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research
teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions
empowered with new skillsets and mindsets for modern data-intensive
science. Learn these Champions' stories through our [blog](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/tags/case-study/), [media](https://www.openscapes.org/media), as well as steps for you to [supercharge your research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4).
