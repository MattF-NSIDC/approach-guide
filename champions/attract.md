*Could also be titled: attracting research teams?*



## Overview

We work with Partners to attract research teams interested in the Cohort. This coordinating work begins \~2.5 months before the cohort will start, and the time allows for preparing text for communications (announcement emails, twitter, and website and google form), having a \~1 month long nomination period, selection, and 1:1 interviews with each team lead prior to the cohort starting.

We focus our engagement/recruitment of team leads (i.e. PIs) to coordinate for their teams.

## Example text

When we work with partners we provide the following in a Google Doc as a starting place to edit and coordinate.
