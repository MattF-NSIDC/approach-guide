We work with our Partners to plan a Champions Cohort, which includes planning details, scheduling dates, and preparing the engagement strategy to share the opportunity and attract research teams interested in better practices for their research.

## High-level timeline

1. [**Partners Planning Call**](#partners-planning-call): Kicks off collaboration.
1. [**Schedule Cohort Dates**](#schedule-cohort-dates): Set dates as early as possible.
1. [**Pre-Cohort Engagement**](/champions/pre-cohort-engage.md): ~2 months prior to Cohort start date. 
1. [**Leading Cohort Calls**](/champions/leading-cohort-calls): 2-4 months.

## Partners Planning Call {#partners-planning-call}

The Partner Planning Call kicks of the collaboration. In this meeting we share lessons learned from recent Cohorts, introduce cohort structure and teams, [Pre-Cohort Engagement](/champions/pre-cohort-engage.md), and onboarding any assistants. Partners share more about the research community, and we discuss the planning timeline and propose dates for the Cohort. 

## Schedule Cohort Dates {#schedule-cohort-dates}

Schedule the Cohort dates early as possible!!

We have found this procedure to work best: 

1. **We schedule date-times** for all Cohort Calls that work for anyone involved with leading the Cohort Calls. This includes asking/exploring for any big conflicts like conferences that this community attends.
1. **We announce the opportunity ~2 months ahead** with the scheduled date-times and ask for team leads to nominate their teams. We’ve found setting the date-times in advance (no doodle) streamlines scheduling and it makes this event seem more “official”. Plus, having team leads commit to the times on behalf of their whole teams creates more buy-in.

## Example: Scheduling date times 

> The [NAME] Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from September - October 2021. We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom four times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Thursdays or Fridays. We propose the following three options (we’ll send Google Calendar Invites when confirmed). Would these times work for us: 

> **Option 1) Thursdays at 12-1:30 pm ET.** 
Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28

> **Option 2) Thursdays at 2-3:30 pm ET.** 
Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28

> **Option 3) Fridays at 12-1:30 pm ET.** 
Dates: September 17, October 1, 15 & 29
