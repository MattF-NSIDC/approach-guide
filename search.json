    "section": "",
    "text": "Also posted at https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct\nVersion 2.0, April 2020\n\nOur community is the most valuable thing about Openscapes.\nSupporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\nSummary\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include RStudio, Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick’s lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie’s twitter thread and the coop at Fred Hutch."

Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly and designing it so that you can also use the guide to use the Openscapes Approach on your own. We encourage anyone to use and “fork” it to make it your own (particularly as it’s a bit more developed!).\nWe complete a full revolution of our Flywheel each time we lead the Champions Program.\n\n\n\nOpenscapes flywheel shows 6 points around a hexagon: Develop, Invest, Attract, Deliver, Transform, Inspire\n\n\nEach turn of the flywheel delivers the Champions program for a Cohort of research teams so that they can begin transforming their workflows towards kinder, inclusive open science and inspire their broader communities. We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, by investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn new software and inclusive practices and to meet specific Cohort needs, and by attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork to welcome more folks to the open science movement.\nThis book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus with developing mentors and delivering the Champions Program.\n\nBuilt with Quarto\nWe’re collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto: https://quarto.org. Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown, which we use to openly develop and publish all Openscapes websites, books, and blogs. Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered natively using Jupyter and Knitr engines."

It’s a nice practice that our team does together (to work on your own but have a buddy available over Zoom) and it’s nice to offer as a practice to the Champions too. Champions have said it’s a really nice practice to take back to their research groups and it’s also a nice way to continue to build community and a learning culture and practice talking about data needs and screensharing.\nWe set up an hour of Co-Working in between weeks; these are optional times where folks can work on their own things but also share and ask questions. Read more about co-working (Butland & Penfold 2020). Here is an example agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Co-working agenda\n\n\n\n\n\nWe share what we’re going to work on, and then work quietly and then check in at the end as well. We also make breakout rooms for Q&A if folks want to screenshare and talk things out.\n\nBrief intros to share what we’re planning to work on\nCreate breakout rooms based on topics, and you can move yourself. Today:\n\nProjectBoards\nChattierRoom - Eli there for Q&A. Pop in and out.\n\nBrief closing to share what you did & any resources!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nChampions teams will hold Seaside Chats, and we share suggested topics each Cohort Call."

    "text": "The following can be built into a statement of work with our Partners.\n\nSummary and Scope\nOpenscapes offers mentorship, training, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science to help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\nThe Openscapes Approach supports the vision laid out by the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)’s Open Science by Design report. Our approach for doing better, more reproducible and inclusive team science in less time, is to first support scientists to create workflows that allow sharing with themselves (Future You) as well as with their teams and collaborators (Future Us). Future Us considers our teams, communities, and those who will be joining and continuing our work, whether that is next hours, weeks or decades (Lowndes & Robinson, 2021).\nOften we find that research teams are not sharing openly, internally among themselves. By considering and creating practices that support Future Us, the Openscapes approach helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern data management and sharing skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches promote kinder science through technical tooling and diversity, equity, and inclusion, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for scientific research teams to explore open data science, including data management and sharing practices. It is a remote-by-design mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. Participants attend a Champions cohort series as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g., R/RStudio, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nThrough the Champions cohort series, a cohort of 6-8 teams will meet 5 times over 2 months for 1.5-hour video calls. These small-time requirements over longer time frames enable incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules and varying expertise and needs.\nChampions Cohort Goals\nThe goals of the Champions cohort series is to help teams normalize open data science discussions, identify shared needs and how to address them, and how to think ahead so they can more effectively onboard themselves and others on new (and existing) projects. We will:\n\nHelp participants adopt open science tooling and practices, including teamwork, reproducibility, openness, collaboration, inclusion, share methods sooner\nExplore practices that build trust and community within and across teams (across career stages)\nImprove ease and confidence in sharing imperfect work within their teams and cohort\nEmpower participants to become champions for more collaborative, open science within their teams and transform their own workflows.\nCreate leaders within a research community to champion open science best practices\n\n\n\nServices\nOpenscapes will provide the curriculum, agendas, and lead the remote cohort series. The curriculum will be based on the lesson series available at: https://openscapes.org/series.\n\nOpenscapes mindset, Better science in less time\nGitHub Clinic, Team culture\nTechnical strategies for future us\nCoding communities, Research examples\nSharing Pathways forward\n\nAdditionally, we lead:\n\nCommunity engagement leading up to, throughout, and after the Cohort\nCo-working sessions to strengthen skills and teamwork\n\nOpenscapes will co-create recruiting materials (e.g., openscapes.org/events), and will lightly email participants preceding, throughout, and following the workshop. The Openscapes team will provide curriculum, support coordination, and teach the remote workshop series along with workshop helpers. We are beginning to evaluate the Champions program as well.\nNote: Participants attend as teams. Participants attend as teams including team leads (e.g., PIs, program managers, faculty) and team members (e.g., analysts, post-docs, students, technicians). The goals of combining team leads and members across varying skill sets and expertise are:\n\nEveryone sees the value in open project management and data sharing practices\nLeads enable their team members to invest time in learning skills and developing lab workflows\nTeam members have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open science, data management and sharing concepts into their research\nEveryone contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and online, in whatever capacity their role and circumstances allow.

The Quicklinks planning Issues tracks collective TODO’s as a checklist and has “quick links” that are nice to have handy for planning and when leading Cohort Calls (the ParticipantsList is important for making team breakout rooms!).\nWe experimented doing this in the openscapes/cohort-planning repository and also in the Cohort repo itself. In the cohort’s repo it’s one less place for Mentors to keep track of and there is the added benefit of an example issue in the repo for the GitHub Clinic. But it means that you have to set up the Cohort repo first - see next.\nHere is an example to paste into an issue, for example: https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2022-nasa-champions/issues/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Quicklinks planning Issue checklist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuicklinks\n\n[LessonPlannning Spreadsheet [ 2022-nasa ]]\n[ParticipantsList - [ 2022-nasa ] ]\n[Planning Folder] - to share with Mentors\n[Cohort Folder] - to share with Champions (a subfolder within planning folder)\n\n\nThis issue is to help track the pre-cohort setup, following the approach-guide and focused on the engagement and tech setup after participants have been selected.\nThese TODO’s are for @jules32 unless otherwise noted. cc: @erinmr\n\n\nFor Cohort Planning Team\n\n\ninvite co-leads/assists to Google Calendar Cohort Calls\n\ninvite co-leads/assists to Google Calendar Co-workings in alternate weeks\n\ncreate GitHub Team with co-leads/assists\n\ncreate Quicklinks issue and pin, tag assists team\n\ncreate planning Google Folder: Engage-2022-NASA (should rename this for consistency)\n\nadd co-leads/assists to Google Folder\n\nsetup Planning Doc\n\nfor Seaside Chats doc, add co-leads/assists\n\n\n\nFor Participants\n\n\ncreate Google Folder: Openscapes_CohortCalls [ 2022-nasa ]\n\nadd participants emails to Openscapes_CohortCalls [ 2022-nasa ] - Do this the day before Cohort Call 1\n\nadd participants emails to Google Calendar Invites: Cohort Calls\n\ndraft welcome email\n\nsend welcome email\n\nsend “reminder” email 1 day before, after adding participants to Openscapes_CohortCalls [ 2021-noaa-afsc ]\n\ncreate GitHub repo: <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/2022-nasa\n\n\n\nAfter Call 1\n\n\nAdd participant emails to Slack; create cohort channel\n\nadd participants emails to Google Calendar Invites: Co-working times (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer to make this planning issue in the openscapes/cohort-planning repo, that is great too. Here was our original details: This repo coordinates across cohorts, so it’s best to “unwatch” except when you’re tagged and then we tag each issue with the folks involved. We’re using GitHub teams to group folks involved in each cohort and easily tag them. This way, we can all learn and coordinate across cohorts when we want to poke through the issues but aren’t cluttered with emails. Two starting Issues to make:\n\n“Quicklinks” Issue with links nice to have open during Cohort Calls. Example: 2022-nmfs-afsc. We pin this issue so that it shows up at the top of https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues\n“Pre-cohort setup: Issue with check-boxes aligned with this approach-guide so we know what’s been done.

In 2022 we’ll re-instate the GitHub Clinic into Cohort Call 2, and increase the number of Cohort Calls to 5.\nDuring the Clinic, the Tech Host will make breakout groups, either based on their actual research team or as a random breakout group, depending on whether they attend with their team. We use the Cohort’s ParticipantsList spreadsheet to assist with identifying teams, and we also ask people to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team.\nThe Facilitator leads the agenda, and Teacher talks through the slides and screenshares.\nTeam members can also circulate in the breakout rooms to check in, help, and share.\nPreparing for the GitHub Clinic involves:\n\nadding participant GitHub usernames to the Cohort’s repo\nreviewing the slides"

This is so there is buy-in for the team to invest time into learning with the Openscapes Cohort. The Cohort will explore software and practices that help teams collaborate more efficiently, and are not only for people who code or work with data.\nWe begin this engagement once we’ve scheduled the dates, ~2 months before the Cohort begins: see the Program Design Chapter for details about timing."

    "text": "Selection and coordination\nSelection and coordination varies somewhat depending on the Cohort. Academic cohorts are most often nominated by faculty PI, so first email communications are with them and then team/lab/group members are added as a second step as teams confirm, and finally we write the cohort as a whole. Government cohorts are often selected within the agency with less focus on “team lead”, and so email communications are sent out to the whole cohort from the start. Below are examples of the Academic cohort process, ending with the Cohort Welcome email to the whole cohort - see there for examples for welcoming government groups as well.\nWe have example text for these that we will pull into a template Google Doc and link here \n\nSelection rubric\nWe have a selection rubric and work with partners to select participating teams. Many groups have their own internal process however, and that’s great.\n\n\nEmail to confirm team leads\nWhen teams have nominated themselves, we send an email to potential team leads with more details and ask them to reply cc’ing their teams and scheduling 1:1 intro calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email welcome to selected PIs\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Welcome to the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort 🎉\nDear [PI],\nThank you for nominating your team to participate in the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort! We are excited for you to be a part of the cohort; this email is your official acceptance.

We will then add you and your team to Google Calendar invites for all 4 Cohort Calls.\n\nOur cohort page details the dates and times, as well as some background about Openscapes and FDD. We will also email the full cohort closer to the September 17 start date.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions!

This was our first open call and we had more interest than we expected, and have not been able to accept all of the great teams that applied. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able to include you in our CS&S cohort.\nWe will be looking to offer more opportunities like this one as we grow Openscapes as a program, and invite you to stay tuned through our (infrequent) newsletter and via Twitter @openscapes.

Through the Champions program we help research groups reimagine data-intensive science, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. The Champions Program is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate.\nYou can learn more about past cohorts at openscapes.org/blog (including NEFSC, NWFSC, NMFS, and FDD cohorts), as well as openscapes.org/media.\nPreparing for our Cohort. This week, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links for our 5 Cohort Calls starting Jan 28. You’ve also received invites for optional Co-working times in ~alternating weeks (described more below). If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\n[Book a 30-minute intro call on Jan 20 or 21] – or suggest other times if that is not possible. These “1:1’s” are a chance for your team to meet the Openscapes team, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. Please discuss with your team and book a time (one time per team).\n\nWe’ll email again following the intro calls with more information, and ask that you read Lowndes et al 2017: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools before January 28.\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know.\nSchedule “Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “Seaside Chats” and suggest you schedule them with your team now. People usually schedule these as 60-min meetings but you can make them whatever length you want. Megsie, Em, and Josh are able to join some of your Seaside Chats as well to help.\nOptional “Co-working” sessions: times to implement what we’ve learned during Cohort Calls, where we work on our own projects at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up, be accountable for, and get feedback on focused work, and sometimes this involves breakout rooms and screensharing to plan and problem solve.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we’re looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort.\nCheers,\nJulie, Em, Josh, and Megsie\n\n\n\n\nWeek prior\n~1 week prior to the beginning of the Cohort, we email the full Cohort, welcoming everyone and sharing the plan and a few action items.

Most of our guest teachers are Champions from previous cohorts (Jessica is a Champion from the 2019-inaugural cohort), and we are able to offer an honorarium for their time and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to guest teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nHi [ potential guest teacher],\nHow are you? I hope you’ve had a break this summer and are doing ok with everything going on.\nOpenscapes a few Champions cohorts we’re leading this fall, including one with researchers using fisheries dependent data in the US Northeast coordinated by Gavin Fay, Andy Jones, and Rachel Baum (here’s the cohort page).\nWe wanted to see if you’d be interested in being a guest teacher at one of these Cohort Calls for 20-25 minutes, presenting ~12 mins of slides and leading the following discussion (likely breakout groups and then group discussion). We’re thinking of you joining the second call and presenting about data strategies for future us, or the third and presenting about coding strategies for future us. You could either present from our existing slide decks, or present something on-theme from your work, and we can help you with the format and timing. Cohort Calls 2 & 3 are on October 1 & 15 from 12-1:30pm ET (exact time TBD but you’re welcome to just attend for your part). We are able to offer an honorarium as well.\nWe’re excited to hear your ideas, and if this isn’t the right thing now to think about if there’s another way we can involve you in the future if you’d like. We’d love to chat with you about it in any case, would you be able to suggest a few times for a 30-minute call?\nCheers,\nJulie and Erin\n\n\n\nFollowup email the week before:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to guest teacher: week prior\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Emily and Chanté,\nWe’re excited about your guest teaching and wanted to check in about it. We’ve had a good first week and two GitHub Clinics and people are excited to learn from how you both work!\nI’ve just shared our [draft Agenda] for this second Cohort Call on October 1, with Emily planned for 11:45-12:20. Would you be able to share your plan by Sept 30 and we can iterate? We can work with you and iterate the discussion prompts following your slides if you’d like, and whether it would make most sense to have more of a group discussion rather than breakouts.\nHow does all this sound? Happy to meet to chat about it/review together if you have questions, or continue discussions by email.\nThank you!\nCheers,\nJulie"

This includes asking/exploring for any big conflicts like conferences that this community attends.\nWe announce the opportunity ~2 months ahead with the scheduled date-times and ask for team leads to nominate their teams. We’ve found setting the date-times in advance (no doodle) streamlines scheduling and it makes this event seem more “official”. Plus, having team leads commit to the times on behalf of their whole teams creates more buy-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Scheduling date times\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [NAME] Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from September - October 2021. We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom four times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Thursdays or Fridays. We propose the following three options (we’ll send Google Calendar Invites when confirmed). Would these times work for us:\n\n\nOption 1) Thursdays at 12-1:30 pm ET. Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28\n\n\nOption 2) Thursdays at 2-3:30 pm ET. Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28\n\n\nOption 3) Fridays at 12-1:30 pm ET.

Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd — meaning it’s a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond — but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is “served” locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we’ll explore later)."
