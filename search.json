    "title": "Code of Conduct",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Also posted at https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct\nVersion 2.0, April 2020\n\nOur community is the most valuable thing about Openscapes.\nSupporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\nSummary\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include RStudio, Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick’s lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie’s twitter thread and the coop at Fred Hutch."

Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd — meaning it’s a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond — but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is “served” locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we’ll explore later)."

We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, by investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn new software and inclusive practices and to meet specific Cohort needs, and by attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork to welcome more folks to the open science movement.\nThis book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus with developing mentors and delivering the Champions Program.\n\nBuilt with Quarto\nWe’re collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto: https://quarto.org.

Our approach for doing better, more reproducible and inclusive team science in less time, is to first support scientists to create workflows that allow sharing with themselves (Future You) as well as with their teams and collaborators (Future Us). Future Us considers our teams, communities, and those who will be joining and continuing our work, whether that is next hours, weeks or decades (Lowndes & Robinson, 2021).\nOften we find that research teams are not sharing openly, internally among themselves. By considering and creating practices that support Future Us, the Openscapes approach helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern data management and sharing skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches promote kinder science through technical tooling and diversity, equity, and inclusion, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for scientific research teams to explore open data science, including data management and sharing practices. It is a remote-by-design mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. Participants attend a Champions cohort series as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g., R/RStudio, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nThrough the Champions cohort series, a cohort of 6-8 teams will meet 4 times over 2 months for 1.5-hour video calls. These small-time requirements over longer time frames enable incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules and varying expertise and needs.\nChampions Cohort Goals\nThe goals of the Champions cohort series is to help teams normalize open data science discussions, identify shared needs and how to address them, and how to think ahead so they can more effectively onboard themselves and others on new (and existing) projects. We will:\n\nCreate leaders within a research community to champion open science best practices\nHelp participants adopt open science tooling and practices, including reproducibility, openness, collaboration, inclusion, share methods sooner\nExplore practices that build trust and community within and across teams (across career stages)\nImprove ease and confidence in sharing imperfect work within their teams and cohort\nEmpower participants to become champions for more collaborative, open science within their teams and transform their own workflows.\n\n\n\nServices\nOpenscapes will provide the curriculum, agendas, and lead the remote cohort series. The curriculum will be based on the lesson series available at: https://openscapes.org/series.\n\nOpenscapes mindset, Better science in less time\nTeam culture, Technical strategies for future us\nCoding communities, Research examples\nSharing Pathways forward\n\nAdditionally, we lead:\n\nGitHub Clinics for hands-on team skill-building\nCommunity engagement leading up to, throughout, and after the Cohort\n\nOpenscapes will co-create recruiting materials (e.g., openscapes.org/events), and will lightly email participants preceding, throughout, and following the workshop. The Openscapes team will provide curriculum, support coordination, and teach the remote workshop series along with workshop helpers. We are beginning to evaluate the Champions program as well.\nNote: Participants attend as teams. Participants attend as teams including team leads (e.g., PIs, program managers, faculty) and team members (e.g., analysts, post-docs, students, technicians). The goals of combining team leads and members across varying skill sets and expertise are: 1) Everyone sees the value in open project management and data sharing practices 2) Leads enable their team members to invest time in learning skills and developing lab workflows 3) Team members have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open science, data management and sharing concepts into their research 4) Everyone contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and online, in whatever capacity their role and circumstances allow.

    "text": "The Openscapes Champions Series describe the lessons we currently teach, with each lesson represented as a book chapter with linked slides. During Cohort Calls we teach from the slides and not from the book chapters; the chapters will ultimately be a stand-alone resource for self-paced learning (this is a work in progress).\nEach lesson is a 10-15 minute slide deck or demo, and there are two lessons per Cohort Call. Lessons are taught followed by an activity so particpants can reflect how topics apply to their own work (see more about agenda structure).\nWe review our planned lessons before we teach. We add relevant updates and links; there are new examples and features that we add! It’s a balance of adding these to slides or book chapters so that the slides have up-to-date information but aren’t too overwhelming."

We use the Cohort’s ParticipantsList spreadsheet to assist with identifying teams, and we also ask people to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team.\nThe Facilitator leads the agenda, and Teacher talks through the slides and screenshares.\nTeam members can also circulate in the breakout rooms to check in, help, and share.\nPreparing for the GitHub Clinic involves:\n\nmaking a copy of the GitHub Clinic Agenda\nadding participant GitHub usernames to the Cohort’s repo\nreviewing the slides\n\n\n\nCo-working\nNot Office Hours\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nChampions teams will hold Seaside Chats."
