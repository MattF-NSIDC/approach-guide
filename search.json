    "text": "The following can be built into a statement of work with our Partners.\n\nSummary and Scope\nThe Openscapes team will lead a 2- or 4 month Champions Cohot: a remote workshop series for a cohort of research teams.. The cohort of 6-8 teams (up to 40 participants; ~4 individuals/team) meets twice monthly over 2 or 4 months for 1.5-hour video calls. These small-time requirements over longer time frames enable incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists‚Äô busy schedules and varying expertise and needs.\nThe goals of the Champions workshop series are to help teams normalize data discussions, identify shared needs and how to address them, and how to think ahead so they can more effectively onboard themselves and others onto new (and existing) projects.\nWorkshop goals include:\n\nCreate leaders within a research community to champion open science best practices\nHelp participants adopt open science tooling and practices, including reproducibility, openness, collaboration, inclusion, share methods sooner\nParticipants build trust and community within and across teams (across career stages)\nParticipants are more confident sharing imperfect work within their teams and cohort\nParticipants become champions for open science and part of the bigger open science movement\n\n\n\nServices\nOpenscapes will provide the curriculum, agendas, and lead the remote workshop series. The curriculum will be based on the lesson series available at: https://openscapes.org/series.\n\nOpenscapes mindset, Better science in less time\nTeam culture, Technical strategies for future us\nCoding communities, Research examples\nSharing Pathways forward\n\nAdditionally, we lead:\n\nGitHub Clinics for hands-on team skill-building\nCommunity engagement leading up to, throughout, and after the Cohort\n\nOpenscapes will co-create recruiting materials (e.g., openscapes.org/events), and will lightly email participants preceding, throughout, and following the workshop. The Openscapes team will provide curriculum, support coordination, and teach the remote workshop series along with workshop helpers."

This includes asking/exploring for any big conflicts like conferences that this community attends.\nWe announce the opportunity ~2 months ahead with the scheduled date-times and ask for team leads to nominate their teams. We‚Äôve found setting the date-times in advance (no doodle) streamlines scheduling and it makes this event seem more ‚Äúofficial.‚Äù Plus, having team leads commit to the times on behalf of their whole teams creates more buy-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Scheduling date times\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [NAME] Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from September - October 2021. We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom four times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Thursdays or Fridays. We propose the following three options (we‚Äôll send Google Calendar Invites when confirmed). Would these times work for us:\n\n\nOption 1) Thursdays at 12-1:30 pm ET.

We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn and to meet specific Cohort needs, and attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork.\nThis book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus with developing mentors and delivering the Champions Program.\n\nBuilt with Quarto\nWe‚Äôre collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto: https://quarto.org.

    "text": "We‚Äôre developing the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto: quarto.org. Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond ‚Äî but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is ‚Äúserved‚Äù locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we‚Äôll explore later)."

    "title": "Code of Conduct",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Also posted at https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct\nVersion 2.0, April 2020\n\nOur community is the most valuable thing about Openscapes.\nSupporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don‚Äôt expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other‚Äôs ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes ‚Äì if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it‚Äôs not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don‚Äôt seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people‚Äôs participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture\nUsing pronouns other than ‚Äúhe‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äù\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to ‚Äúwin‚Äù every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. ‚ÄúWinning‚Äù is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others‚Äô needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people‚Äôs right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one‚Äôs native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\nSummary\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla‚Äôs inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include RStudio, Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick‚Äôs lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie‚Äôs twitter thread and the coop at Fred Hutch."
