    "text": "About This Guide\nWe’ve been growing Openscapes since founding it in 2018. This is our attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others as we grow. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly and designing it so that you can also use the guide to use the Openscapes Approach on your own. We encourage anyone to use and “fork” it to make it your own (particularly as it’s a bit more developed!).\nWe complete a full revolution of our Flywheel each time we lead the Champions Program.\n\n\n\nOpenscapes flywheel shows 6 points around a hexagon: Develop, Invest, Attract, Deliver, Transform, Inspire\n\n\nEach turn of the flywheel delivers the Champions program for a Cohort of research teams so that they can begin transforming their workflows towards kinder, inclusive open science and inspire their broader communities. We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, by investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn new software and inclusive practices and to meet specific Cohort needs, and by attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork to welcome more folks to the open science movement.\nThis book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus with developing mentors and delivering the Champions Program.\n\nBuilt with Quarto\nWe’re collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto. Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown, which we use to openly develop and publish all Openscapes websites, books, and blogs. Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered natively using Jupyter and Knitr engines. We are gradually converting to build all our materials with Quarto."

    "text": "The following can be built into a statement of work with our Partners.\n\n\nOpenscapes offers mentorship, training, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science to help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\nThe Openscapes Approach supports the vision laid out by the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)’s Open Science by Design report. Our approach for doing better, more reproducible and inclusive team science in less time, is to first support scientists to create workflows that allow sharing with themselves (Future You) as well as with their teams and collaborators (Future Us). Future Us considers our teams, communities, and those who will be joining and continuing our work, whether that is next hours, weeks or decades (Lowndes & Robinson, 2021).\nOften we find that research teams are not sharing openly, internally among themselves. By considering and creating practices that support Future Us, the Openscapes approach helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern data management and sharing skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches promote kinder science through technical tooling and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for scientific research teams to explore open data science, including data management and sharing practices. It is a remote-by-design mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. Participants attend a Champions cohort series as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g., R/RStudio, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research and work, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nThrough the Champions cohort series, a cohort of 6-8 teams will meet 5 times over 2 months for 1.5-hour video calls. These small-time requirements over longer time frames enable incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules and varying expertise and needs.\nChampions Cohort Goals\nThe goals of the Champions cohort series is to help teams normalize open data science discussions, identify shared needs and how to address them, and how to think ahead so they can more effectively onboard themselves and others on new (and existing) projects. We will:\n\nHelp participants adopt open science tooling and practices, including teamwork, reproducibility, openness, collaboration, inclusion, share methods sooner\nExplore practices that build trust and community within and across teams (across career stages)\nImprove ease and confidence in sharing imperfect work within their teams and cohort\nEmpower participants to become champions for more collaborative, open science within their teams and transform their own workflows.\nCreate leaders within a research community to champion open science best practices\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes will provide the curriculum, agendas, and lead the remote cohort series. The curriculum will be based on the lesson series available at: https://openscapes.org/series.\n\nOpenscapes mindset, Better science in less time\nGitHub Clinic, Team culture\nTechnical strategies for future us\nCoding communities, Research examples\nSharing Pathways forward\n\nAdditionally, we lead:\n\nCommunity engagement leading up to, throughout, and after the Cohort\nCo-working sessions to strengthen skills and teamwork\n\nOpenscapes will co-create recruiting materials (e.g., Champions Cohort listings at openscapes.org/events), and will lightly email participants preceding, throughout, and following the workshop. The Openscapes team will provide curriculum, support coordination, and teach the remote lesson series along with helpers. We are beginning to evaluate the Champions program as well.\nNote: Participants attend as teams. Teams include team leads (e.g., PIs, program managers, faculty) and team members (e.g., analysts, post-docs, students, technicians). The goals of combining team leads and members across varying skill sets and expertise are:\n\nEveryone sees the value in open project management and data sharing practices\nLeads enable their team members to invest time in learning skills and developing open and reproducible lab workflows\nTeam members have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open science, data management and sharing concepts into their research\nEveryone contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and online, in whatever capacity their role and circumstances allow.\n\nSee also the Champions Program FAQ."

The Cohort will explore software and practices that help teams collaborate more efficiently, and are not only for people who code or work with data.\nWe begin this engagement once we’ve scheduled the dates, ~2 months before the Cohort begins: see the Program Design Chapter for details about timing.\nDepending on the Cohort, recruitment may happen by the partners internally rather than by Openscapes. Approaches we’ve iterated/formalized can still help in these cases - for example having a public webpage with all information (which gives it some official “weight” and is also a single place to point folks to for details), and focusing on engaging and building trust with team leads so that their teams are approved to spend time."

Academic cohorts are most often nominated by faculty PI, so first email communications are with them and then team/lab/group members are added as a second step as teams confirm, and finally we write the cohort as a whole. Government cohorts are often selected within the agency with less focus on “team lead”, and so email communications are sent out to the whole cohort from the start. Below are examples of the Academic cohort process, ending with the Cohort Welcome email to the whole cohort - see there for examples for welcoming government groups as well.\nWe have example text for these that we will pull into a template Google Doc and link here \n\nSelection rubric\nWe have a selection rubric and work with partners to select participating teams. Many groups have their own internal process however, and that’s great.\n\n\nEmail to confirm team leads\nWhen teams have nominated themselves, we send an email to potential team leads with more details and ask them to reply cc’ing their teams and scheduling 1:1 intro calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email welcome to selected PIs\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Welcome to the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort 🎉\nDear [PI],\nThank you for nominating your team to participate in the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort!

Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate.\nYou can learn more about past cohorts at openscapes.org/blog (including NEFSC, NWFSC, NMFS, and FDD cohorts), as well as openscapes.org/media.\nPreparing for our Cohort. This week, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links for our 5 Cohort Calls starting Jan 28. You’ve also received invites for optional Co-working times in ~alternating weeks (described more below). If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\n[Book a 30-minute intro call on Jan 20 or 21] – or suggest other times if that is not possible. These “1:1’s” are a chance for your team to meet the Openscapes team, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. Please discuss with your team and book a time (one time per team).\n\nWe’ll email again following the intro calls with more information, and ask that you read Lowndes et al 2017: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools before January 28.\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know.\nSchedule “Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “Seaside Chats” and suggest you schedule them with your team now. People usually schedule these as 60-min meetings but you can make them whatever length you want. Megsie, Em, and Josh are able to join some of your Seaside Chats as well to help.\nOptional “Co-working” sessions: times to implement what we’ve learned during Cohort Calls, where we work on our own projects at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up, be accountable for, and get feedback on focused work, and sometimes this involves breakout rooms and screensharing to plan and problem solve.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we’re looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort.\nCheers,\nJulie, Em, Josh, and Megsie\n\n\n\n\nWeek prior\n~1 week prior to the beginning of the Cohort, we email the full Cohort, welcoming everyone and sharing the plan and a few action items. This includes providing an email address that can access Google Drive and their GitHub username!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to welcome (academic) cohort: week prior\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Openscapes – SASI Champions Cohort\nHello All,\nWe are so excited to welcome you to the 2021 SASI Openscapes Champions Cohort! Our first Cohort Call is in one week on September 9 and we wanted to share some information with you.\nPlan.\nOpenscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time. Through the Champions program we help research groups reimagine data-intensive science, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Our Cohort is supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Symbiosis in Aquatic Systems Initiative (SASI), and we’re partnering with protocols.io, a secure platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods.\nBefore Sept 9, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links for our 8 Cohort Calls starting Sept 9. If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\nComplete your information in OpenscapesParticipants [ 2021-sasi ] to make sure you can access the software we’ll use (Google Drive and GitHub).\nRead Lowndes et al 2017: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. Optionally, you can also review the slides/video of a recent plenary.\n\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know.\nSchedule “Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “Seaside Chats” and suggest you schedule them with your team now (PIs do not need to attend).\nThe Champions Program is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate.\nMeet the Openscapes team.\nWe’re the team you’ll see most often on the calls, along with a few guest speakers:\n\nJulie Lowndes, Openscapes founder and co-director, NCEAS, UCSB\nErin Robinson, Openscapes co-director, Metadata Game Changers\nLenny Teytelman, protocols.io founder and CEO\nEmma Ganley, protocols.io Director of Strategic Initiatives\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we’re looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort.\nCheers,\nJulie, Erin, Lenny, and Emma\n\n\n\n\n\nDay prior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to welcome cohort: day prior\n\n\n\n\n\nHi All,\nWe’re excited to meet you all with your teams as a full Cohort tomorrow at [ Time ] Pacific Time!\nYou should have all received Google Calendar invites with the Zoom call-in information; call-in info is also pasted below.

Most of our guest teachers are Champions from previous cohorts (Jessica is a Champion from the 2019-inaugural cohort), and we are able to offer an honorarium for their time and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to guest teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Invitation as guest teacher in Openscapes\nHi [ potential guest teacher],\nHow are you? I hope you’ve had a break this summer and are doing ok with everything going on.\nOpenscapes has a few Champions cohorts we’re leading this fall, including one with researchers using fisheries dependent data in the US Northeast coordinated by Gavin Fay, Andy Jones, and Rachel Baum (here’s the cohort page).\nWe wanted to invite you as a guest teacher at one of these Cohort Calls for 20-25 minutes, presenting ~12 mins of slides and leading the following discussion (likely breakout groups and then group discussion). We’re thinking of you joining the second call and presenting about data strategies for future us, or the third and presenting about coding strategies for future us. You could either present from our existing slide decks, or present something on-theme from your work, and we can help you with the format and timing. Cohort Calls 2 & 3 are on October 1 & 15 from 12-1:30pm ET (exact time TBD but you’re welcome to just attend for your part). We are able to offer an honorarium as well.\nWe’re excited to hear your ideas, and if this isn’t the right thing now to think about if there’s another way we can involve you in the future if you’d like. We’d love to chat with you about it in any case, would you be able to suggest a few times for a 30-minute call?\nCheers,\nJulie and Erin\n\n\n\nFollowup email the week before:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to guest teacher: week prior\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Emily and Chanté,\nWe’re excited about your guest teaching and wanted to check in about it. We’ve had a good first week and two GitHub Clinics and people are excited to learn from how you both work!\nI’ve just shared our [draft Agenda] for this second Cohort Call on October 1, with Emily planned for 11:45-12:20. Would you be able to share your plan by Sept 30 and we can iterate? We can work with you and iterate the discussion prompts following your slides if you’d like, and whether it would make most sense to have more of a group discussion rather than breakouts.\nHow does all this sound? Happy to meet to chat about it/review together if you have questions, or continue discussions by email.\nThank you!\nCheers,\nJulie"

    "text": "Between Cohort Calls\nBetween Calls there are tasks for the Openscapes team and for the Champions teams (that the Openscapes team helps support).\n\nField Notes\nWe ask all co-leads and assistants to write down thoughts about how the cohort went - these are internal “field notes” that will help us improve between Cohort Calls and across Cohorts.\nPrompts to answer include:\n\nTop-of-mind i.e. what would you tell your roommate?\nBrief summary of how it went\nRose / Bud / Thorn - something that was good, developing, or tricky\n\nWrite field notes in the DebriefsDigests Google doc (as of Fall 2022), with one doc for all Cohort Calls. We draft Digests in this same doc.\n\n\nDigests\nWe send digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday) via GitHub Issues.\nDigests include links to the Call’s agenda, the Call’s goals, slides, and some excerpts from the shared notes. Call 1 is sent via email, and following the GitHub Clinic, the rest are sent via GitHub Issues as a way to continue practicing throughtout the cohort.\nWe develop these in a single “DigestsDrafts” Google Doc - with the AFSC Mentors we would co-work on this during a debrief Seaside Chat.\nSee examples:\n\n2022-nasa-champions\n2022-noaa-afsc\n2021-fdd\n2021-noaa-nmfs\n\n\n\nCoworking\nWe started coworking with Cohorts in fall 2021. It’s a nice practice that our team does together (to work on your own but have a buddy available over Zoom) and it’s nice to offer as a practice to the Champions too. Champions have said they appreciate this as a practice to take back to their research groups and it’s also a nice way to continue to build community and a learning culture and practice talking about data needs and screensharing.\nWe set up an hour of Coworking in between weeks; these are optional times where folks can work on their own things but also share and ask questions. Here is an example agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Coworking agenda\n\n\n\n\n\nWe share what we’re going to work on, and then work quietly and then check in at the end as well. We also make breakout rooms for Q&A if folks want to screenshare and talk things out.\n\nBrief intros to share what we’re planning to work on\nCreate breakout rooms based on topics, and you can move yourself. Today:\n\nProjectBoards\nChattierRoom - Eli there for Q&A. Pop in and out.\n\nBrief closing to share what you did & any resources!\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent flavors of coworking\nOur practice of coworking has evolved, particularly through running 4 simultaneous NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022. We use a few flavors now. The take home message is that people can experiment with this practice and see what works for them!\n\nCohort coworking is outlined above and is the standard format we use in Openscapes Champions Cohorts between Calls. In some sessions, we would invite a participant in advance to “screenshare-and-tell” something they did or learned relating to the previous lesson (in the first 5 minutes to get things going). Some teams used these for their Seaside Chats.\nThemed coworking was an experiment in Fall 2022 as a way to bring participants together across Cohorts. These were 1.5-hr sessions with Eli Holmes giving a lesson, followed by coworking in breakout rooms. Typically people stayed in the main room for Q & A.\n\nSmall group or 1:1 coworking is described in (Butland & Penfold 2020).\n\n\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nChampions teams will hold Seaside Chats, and we share suggested topics each Cohort Call.\n\n\nGit / GitHub drop-in help\nAfter the GitHub Clinic lesson it might be helpful to offer optional drop-in help sessions for folks to get set up with Git and GitHub on their local machines.\nEli Holmes recorded 4 short videos that people should watch before attending:\n\nSetting GitHub Desktop Preferences (2.5 mins)\nCloning a repository (2 mins)\nPulling and pushing changes to GitHub (3.5 mins)\nTurning an existing directory into a Git repository and pushing to GitHub (2 min)\n\nIn the Fall 2022 NMFS Cohorts we learned that many people needed help finding where Git was installed on their Windows machines, for example. Collaborative notes with screenshots were added in Google doc: OpenscapesCoworkingCross-Cohort [ 2022-nmfs-fall ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample invitation to Git / GitHub drop-in sessions\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve scheduled 30-minute drop-in sessions for those who want to get their computer connected to Git and GitHub. Drop in and we’ll get you set up!\nWhat should I install beforehand? GitHub Desktop. This is a great option and is especially good if your GitHub repos have files from multiple programs (R, Python, Excel, Word, images, data files). If you install GitHub Desktop, you will have Git installed with that. If you don’t get GitHub Desktop, then you will need to have Git installed.\nOnce you have GitHub Desktop installed, watch the short videos from Eli Holmes to see how to get things set up.\n\nSetting GitHub Desktop Preferences (2.5 mins)\nCloning a repository (2 mins)\nPulling and pushing changes to GitHub (3.5 mins)\nTurning an existing directory into a Git repository and pushing to GitHub (2 min)\n\nGive it a try and if you have any trouble getting connected, come to the drop-in sessions and we’ll help!\n\nDate / time (click to add to your Google Cal)\nDate / time (click to add to your Google Cal)\n\nSee Tip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar for instructions on how to implment this."

Some of this information is echoed in Leading Cohort Calls.\nMost things are set up in advance of the first Cohort Call, with a few things set up following the first Call (e.g. inviting folks to Slack and coworking sessions). We generate and review Agendas prior to each Cohort Call; they are not created all in advance.\nIn this page, we give some general information, then describe things in temporal order.\n\n\nWe use the CohortPlanning GitHub Project to manage the tasks involved in running Openscapes Champions Cohorts (since June 2022) and have created some Issue Templates with checklists. These can be used to quickly set up Issues for new Cohorts.\n\n\n\nIf you’re comfortable following instructions in R (or want to try!), we recommend using our kyber R package created by Sean Kross. kyber contains tools for setting up learning cohorts on GitHub, purpose-built for the Openscapes Champions Program. It automates creation of new GitHub repos and agendas in Google Docs for example, using information from the Cohort Registry (described below). We began using kyber in January 2022, starting with the 2022-afsc winter Cohort.\nWe’ll need to do some configuration to use kyber, so follow the configuration instructions before you need to use it.\nSpecific kyber functions will be described in more detail where relevant to specific tasks below.\n\n\n\nIn June 2022 we began moving our work to an Openscapes Google Workspace, starting with the 2022 NOAA SEFSC summer Cohort.\nFolder organization\n\nOpenscapesMain > OpenscapesChampionsProgram > contains materials for active and completed Cohorts, including 1-on-1’s and specific Cohort Folders.\nOpenscapesMain > OpenscapesCohortPlanning > contains materials for planning Cohorts, including the Cohort Registry and docs for Mentors Seaside Chats.\n\nCalendar: The OpenscapesCohorts Google Calendar is used for events, like Cohort Calls and Coworking sessions. Add CohortFolder to calendar invites; we learned that folks go to Calendars to find the docs for meetings.\nThere are limits to the number of Guests that can be added to a calendar invite. Google does not provide information on the actual limit number. Our recommended strategy is to add ~80 Guests initially, then add additional blocks of 40 Guests on subsequent days. We learned this for Cross-Cohort Coworking sessions for 4 NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we ask people add an event to their own Google Calendar without being added explicitly as a Guest. To do this, in a Calendar Event > click the 3 dots > Publish event > choose Copy Link to event and share link in Slack or email saying “Click URL to add this to your Google Calendar”. We have used this to let people in a Cohort know of an optional impromptu session like drop-in GitHub help, or a screenshare-and-tell for example.\n\n\n\nGoogle Meet: Breakout room functionality in Google Meet is limited (e.g. participant cannot dynamically choose a room to join; host must manually assign them). We prefer to use Zoom when possible.\nGoogle Spaces: We have used Google Spaces for within-Cohort communications like Q&A and resource sharing when that is already the strongly-preferred tool for participants e.g. NOAA NMFS Fall 2022 Cohorts. After Cohort completion, the Openscapes team’s support moves entirely to Slack."

To start, a Cohort repo should include a README and a Code of Conduct.

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom five times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Thursdays or Fridays. We propose the following three options (we’ll send Google Calendar Invites when confirmed). Would these times work for us:\n\n\nOption 1) Thursdays at 12-1:30 pm ET. Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28, November 11\n\n\nOption 2) Thursdays at 2-3:30 pm ET. Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28, November 11\n\n\nOption 3) Fridays at 12-1:30 pm ET. Dates: September 17, October 1, 15 & 29, November 12"

Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd — meaning it’s a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond — but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is “served” locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we’ll explore later)."

Friendly Q & A about good enough practices, team culture, tools …\n#events: Events that might be of interest to others in our community.

Challenge was that every event will list the same duration, while reality was they alternated weekly with 1.5hrs for community call and 1hr for coworking.\n\nEventbrite - Zoom - Google Cal how-to set up an event\nRecommended workflow for now:\n\nCreate Google Cal invite > make it a Zoom meeting from inside that invite (if your Google Cal is integrated with Zoom )> save. That meeting will appear in your Zoom account. Confirm it has waiting room and no password.\nIn Eventbrite, create Event > copy Zoom link into Eventbrite > Event > Online Event Page > Live video or audio, instead of “Add Zoom”\n\nWhat didn’t work well: “Add Zoom” button, which used “Stefanie Butland’s personal meeting room”, created a mtg in Zoom that has a Zoom registration link, not a clear meeting link. Stumped for now as to how to make that Eventbrite-Zoom integration work.\n\n\nCreate and schedule reminder emails.Eventbrite > Manage attendees > Emails to attendees > create one custom reminder email. Set reply-to as hello@openscapes.org. Delete other default reminders (Eventbrite makes 3 reminders by default and that’s annoying). For reminder emails in an event series, we must update for every event in the series.\n\nWe create a custom reminder email with Subject: Zoom link for Openscapes event-name. Body: We’re excited to see you later today! At the session start time (5:00 - 6:00 pm ET), please click to join us in Zoom: LINK. Optional, include event logo or Openscapes logo.\nWhy a custom email reminer? Several community call participants said it was hard to find the zoom link with Eventbrite’s default reminder email (Stef agrees); that’s why we put “Zoom” in subject line of custom reminder.\n\n\n\n\n\nZenodo\nWe want to share our material in a way that other people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it. We use the Zenodo repository for this purpose.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo. GitHub itself is not a repository.\nFor the full picture, this 1-hr webinar is great: Zenodo: open digital repository | 2022.12.07.\n\nCreating a Zenodo Openscapes Community\nWe’re creating and populating a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a “semantically meaningful group” of research products in order to make them easily citable and more visible. Examples: NASA’s Transform to Open Science; Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE).\nZenodo has a Sandbox in which we can create and refine a draft Community before creating the real thing. This webinar section “How to create a community” screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear. Creating a Sandbox first forces you to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than a personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include."

One example is writing a blog post for a workshop on Audience Building and Strategic Planning. This was a lot of work to put together, and we think it’s valuable for others! In addition to posting the slides, how could we amplify it more and tell a story around those slides that make it more sharable? That’s right, a blog post.\nBlog posts take time. A lot of time. And they often feel extra, especially in a culture of needing peer-reviewed publications. But they are super valuable, and important. So, here are some strategies we use to write blogs:\n\nReuse structure. Copy-paste a previous blog post structure. Ah, yes, we have the publish date, the title, the authors up top, some italics introducing what this is and who the authors are, with quick links. Then, 3-4 headers with up to 3 paragraphs each and a few pictures. Delete the content but start from there.\nReuse content. We spend a lot of time planning events and slides - reuse them! Copy text directly from the Agenda docs, and from the slides! Add text to shape the story, but then copy-paste as much as possible. This can be harder with posts that synthesize events (like the 2022 ESIP blog post and upcoming post for 2023). These events require more time to rewatch the recording and synthesize and identify themes, but there is still a lot to be reused, especially quotes!\nShare with co-authors early. But not too early. Often we are trying to do the legwork to get a blog post structured and drafted describing the work they’ve already put into the event or slides. So along with the next point, do this until it’s good enough, and share!\nBe ok with imperfect, and done! Yes, there is more to say if you put months of time into this. And we may find a sentence to be polished after posting, and that’s ok. We aim to share ideas and momentum from our community with the mindset that sharing some and imperfectly is better than silence."

    "text": "Also posted at https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct\nVersion 2.0, April 2020\n\nOur community is the most valuable thing about Openscapes.\nSupporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture, perspective, or background\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nIf you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back, encourage other voices to join in, and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ perspectives, contributions, and needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\nSummary\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include RStudio, Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick’s lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie’s twitter thread and the coop at Fred Hutch."

Ideally we try to include an action so that people understand that these are more than just words. Here are some examples you can reuse or remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Land Acknowledgments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI live and work on the traditional lands of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc [she-KWE-pem] within Secwépemc’ulucw [she-KWE-pem-cooluc], the traditional and unceded territory of the Secwépemc [she-KWE-pem] peoples. One thing I do to learn more is attend the annual Kamloopa powwow. Kukstemcw (thank you!) for joining us today.\n\nTo learn more about the land(s) you’re on: https://native-land.ca/. You can also text your zip code to this number and it will tell you the land(s) you’re on: 1-907-312-5085.\n\nI work on endangered and threatened PNW salmonids. Salmon are central to the Native Nations of the Puget Sound region and coast, the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, Skokomish, Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakama Nations. I see the foresight of the leaders of the Pacific Northwest Native Nations who wrote in clauses to ensure perpetual access to their ancestral fishing locations in the treaties of the mid-1800s. I acknowledge the determination of the next generations who protested on the water and in the courts to force these treaties to be upheld. Now, I work to educate myself on this history and specifically on the Boldt Decision and its aftermath. As a federal employee, I am part of the system that upholds these treaties and court decisions. I am aware that I am not knowledgeable as I want to be and I want to work on this.\nI am grateful I am for the land where I am here in Santa Barbara California and I want to honor the Chumash peoples who have been and continue to be stewards of the lands and waters here.\n\nLand Acknowledgements are one way to amplify the knowledge and work of Indigenous peoples. Here’s a place you can go to learn more: https://native-land.ca/. I’ve learned more about Indigenous sense of place through Robin Wall Kimmerer’s beautiful book Braiding Sweetgrass - Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants.\n\nI acknowledge that the Piscataway Indian Nation continues to maintain a relationship with the lands where I am here in Potomac, MD. The Piscataway Indian Nation received recognition by the State of Maryland in 2012. I acknowledge their long-standing kinship with these lands and waters. To make this statement more meaningful, I invite you to learn more about land acknowledgement statements via https://native-land.ca/ and other resources and to reconsider in what ways you can improve your relationship with the lands and waters you steward.\nI have lived and worked for more than 20 years on lands that are not mine, but those of the Narragansett. The Narragansetts are the namesakes for the town of Narragansett and of Narragansett Bay and they are the traditional caretakers of marine and fresh waters as well as the land that currently makes up most of the state of Rhode Island. To learn more about the Narragansetts and other native peoples of this land visit the Tomaquag Muesuem or consider their virtual programs. Land Acknowledgements are one way to amplify the knowledge and work of Indigenous peoples. Here’s a place you can go to learn more: https://native-land.ca/.\nI am grateful for the land where I am here in St. Petersburg Florida, and I want to honor the Seminole, Miccosukee, and Tocobaga people who took stewardship of this land and surrounding waters. I acknowledge the painful history of genocide and forced removal from their territory, and I respect and honor the diverse Indigenous people still connected to this land.\nThe territory that we now know as South Florida has been the traditional homelands of the Native nations including the Tequesta, the Calusa, and today the sovereign homelands of the Seminole and Miccosukee. I acknowledge that where I live, work, and recreate is located on the ancestral homelands of sovereign Native nations. I reflect on this and pay respects by learning more about ways to support our local Indigenous communities in efforts to preserve Seminole and Miccosukee cultures."

    "section": "About Qualitative Research",
    "text": "About Qualitative Research\n\nWhat is Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA)?\nQualitative Data Analysis (QDA) or qualitative coding is a method of analyzing textual data. Textual data can be drawn from interview or focus group transcripts, observational notes, newspapers, blog posts, social media posts, books, texts and really anything related to the topic. These methods are commonly used in social science fields such as sociology, anthropology, political science, business, education, user experience design and more.\nWhile methods of doing qualitative analysis can vary depending on field and methodological background, the common denominator is that this form of research does what is called “qualitative coding” or qualitative data analysis. Sometimes folks use a computer to do QDA using software such as Taguette, NVivo, Dedoose, Atlas.TI or MaxQDA to name a few.\nFor those who have less experience in social science fields, the terminology of “coding” can be misleading because one might assume we are using the word coding in terms of writing code for analysis. However, this is not how qualitative researchers use the term coding.\nFor scientists, it can help to replace the word “coding” with a word like “annotating” or “tagging” because these terms are more descriptive about what it is that the researcher does in qualitative coding. While there are variations, the typical QDA process is for the researcher or research team to read through the qualitative materials and to develop codes to answer the research questions based on both 1) the patterns seen in the data itself and 2) theoretical and substantive knowledge of the field.\nTo do this, qualitative researchers often start with either existing research, metrics or previous qualitative codebooks to build their understanding of what the data might say and what they should look for.\nResearchers will then go through the data and code (or tag/annotate) selections of the text to summarize a theme or an idea found in the data. This can be as simple as taking short responses to a survey and annotating them with descriptive codes or as complex as using codes to tag quotes from hours long interviews or focus groups.\n\n\nA Note about Qualitative Research\nThere are a few differences in qualitative research that may not be apparent to those who are learning about how to do this work for the first time.\nFirst, In qualitative social science research, we are often using inductive rather than deductive research. In typical scientific research, there is an existing hypothesis and the research design is to test that hypothesis. By contrast, qualitative research may have a general research question that will evolve over the course of the research and inductively be explored. Meaning that we know that there is something here to study, but we aren’t always certain what it is that we’re looking at.\nA good analogy would be if we were a biologist going to a fictional planet to study the life that exists on that planet. We might already have categories of “tree” or “grass” or “bush” from our understanding of plant life on earth and we could use those to begin our work of categorizing what we see on a different planet. That said, we would be aware that these terms might be limited as we are looking at plant life we’ve never seen before. As we learn more about the environment, our categories to understand what we are looking at would evolve. Our research question would also likely evolve as we begin to find patterns and understand the ecosystem. In the same way, as we do qualitative research we are often creating systems to help us understand what we’re seeing/hearing and we’re adapting our research to integrate what we’re learning as we do it. This is how our research can be inductive.\nSecond, the motive and output of qualitative research can be quite distinct from quantitative studies. While it is possible to confirm or refute a hypothesis in qualitative research, it’s not as common as other forms of research output. For instance, qualitative research outputs could be: narratives, explanations of a process or an activity, a list of reasons why people did something, relevant language usage and terms that are unfamiliar. Our analysis might also give us a better understanding of the topic in order to do more research (of any kind), or to write a better research question. It might also be useful for developing relevant hypotheses to do more work on this topic area.\nThis work with Openscapes I would consider to be applied or practical research designed to support the aims of the organization. However when that is not true, such as when a qualitative study is being developed in the academy, the end result can also be to add to theory about a particular topic."

    "text": "QDA for Openscapes\n\nHow we used QDA for Openscapes\nOur research question was “How does Openscapes support teams to transition from closed research practices to open research practices?” We then picked a cohort and decided to use the open agendas from that cohort to develop a codebook. We wanted to get a better sense of how they talked about open research in the agenda that we were looking at. Our hope was that the agendas would be a sort of “living document” that gave us insights into what the discussion was and how participants made meaning of the learning they were gaining in open research.\n\n\nHow we created the Qualitative Codebook for Openscapes Agendas\nInitially we began with the Theory of Change as a way to develop our system of codes/tags (or codebook). But we quickly realized that the categories from the Theory of Change didn’t map well onto the agendas. We changed to work from the Moore Foundation grant goals as a starting place, then when we began to see patterns in the data, we expanded from those goals and added more codes/tags to respond to what we saw in the data.\nThe final research paper reviewed the Moore Foundation goals, the way they showed up in the agendas as well as exploring the inductive topics that came up through the agendas. You can read the final report to see concrete examples.\nThe Openscapes leadership started by coding together and began to notice what worked and what didn’t in coding the agendas. As we went on, we began to add in some codes that we saw as we went through the data.\n\n\nQualitative Codebook\nHere is the codebook that we developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAdoptProtocol.io\nDiscussion of adopting protocols.io (Moore Goal)\n\n\nBuildCommunity\nDiscussion of building community across teams - broader sense of community beyond this group.

    "text": "Working with this QDA in Openscapes Going Forward\n\nDebriefs Following Calls as Data\nOne helpful way to do qualitative research in a collaborative setting is to use debrief calls after the main call is over to write down some of the key important aspects of the call. This allows it to be much easier to do the coding.\nThe team might ask themselves:\n\nWhat were the biggest topics of conversation in the call? What did people want to talk about?\nWhat kinds of questions were participants asking about?\nWhat challenge were they having?\nWhat were some of the wins that they talked about?\n\nThese notes should be added to the text that the team would use for analysis as a kind of “field note” of what the facilitators knew from the room.\nAdditionally, the debrief calls could also be a place where items in the document can be coded with multiple people looking at the document. Each person might take 3-4 codes and go through the document tagging them when they see them in the document. This would enable the coding process to be much less laborious. When there are issues or challenges, the team can talk about them, and consider adding or using certain codes when there are questions.\n\n\nHow to use Taguette\nI recommend that the Openscapes team use Taguette for doing qualitative coding as it is a FLOSS tool that is openly available and capable of collaboration among a group of people. There is documentation at this link for how to get started with Taguette: https://www.taguette.org/getting-started.html\nOver time, the research team may wish to do more complex QDA analyses with the data, however, I encourage the team to focus on the basics of the research instead of getting bogged down with the software. Taguette is a simple program but it does the basics well.\n\n\nUsing the Research\nAfter the cohort is finished and the agendas have been coded, the process of analysis of the research can begin. I encourage the team to consider conducting a synthesis meeting after the coding/tagging has been completed to go through each of the codes and to see what can be learned from each.\nFor instance, to consider over time how the challenges that the agendas shared, or the questions that participants asked can offer some insight into the way that teaching these topics could be done in the future.\n\n\nHow to update the Codebook\nWe can make changes to the codebook and should do so as the research continues. There are a few ways to consider making updates:\nFirst is to consider adding new codes to the codebook: When someone on the research team sees a topic of conversation in the agendas that seems to be a pattern (e.g. they see it in more than three places) and it is helpful to understand something about the research question, it’s a great idea to add a new code to the codebook.\nThe key question to ask before adding a new code/tag is to ask: “Does this code help us answer our research question?” If it does, it should be added. If it’s interesting but not a part of the research question, consider not including it. When adding a code, try to ensure that the one word code/tag makes sense on its own and that there is a written explanation of the definition of that code/tag.\nSecond, the research team may find themselves refining the codes and the explanations. As time goes on, the research team will develop a sense for the differences between codes, when to apply them and when not to. Part of the work is to make sure that the descriptions are clear for the team that is doing the coding and that it can be communicated to researchers in the future.\nThat said, I encourage the team to be careful of not complexifying the coding/tagging system too much. It’s a common mistake among beginner qualitative researchers to code EVERYTHING and to make a monstrous codebook with every small bit of data. Not everything needs to be coded. Be sure to refer back to “Is this going to help us understand the research question more effectively? When doing any editing."
