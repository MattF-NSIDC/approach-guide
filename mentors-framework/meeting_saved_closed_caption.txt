[Julia Lowndes] 14:52:04
Okay, great. So what we were talking about is thinking out loud the kind of the places where we have information about the NASA mentors.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:52:17
And kind of the purposes of each of these places. And the audience. And I'm just kinda saying this out loud so that.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:52:28
We can think about if this is a good idea. Makes sense for NASA. And how we might.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:52:37
Do the same thing or iterate. For Noah, as we build the, the mentor community.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:52:43
Okay. So. This is the So NASA opens. Dot github.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:52:53
I/O is the main URL we give to everyone that's the main place that NASA openscapes lives and this mentors page here, the purpose of it was to first of all have a link to give to people to know the information about what is.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:53:16
The deck, the cross stack mentor community and what is the time commitment. So this kind of expected time commitment here is, is here and this is text that we partly wrote so that it's here when people come to this URL, but also like copying this text and the emails to send to managers or something we've done a lot.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:53:37
So that's the main purposes. Like, what is the mentor community? Here, here's what it is.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:53:43
The second. Purpose is to give visibility to for our activities at a somewhat changing.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:53:52
Granularity. So right now we've got 2030, 23 goals at a high level.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:53:59
And I've just updated the schedule to be. A bit more granular here with these guest speakers we have coming up.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:54:07
But you see that in the past. We haven't really had that. So as we're opening up.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:54:12
This is a place where we could ultimately send people and even put a zoom link here if we ever get there, but that this is like a place.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:54:19
That exist for that purpose. About the coiled information here. But then maybe the next, the next most important thing is to give visibility for the mentors.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:54:30
So this was a place to have everybody's name. And see we've iterated this a bit like we had an asterisk after the people who had been part of this.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:54:41
Since 2021. But as we shift from cohort. To community, that's less important and so we can update this as and make sure we've got everybody's bios as we go forward.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:54:52
So that's what this page is, is so it's like most public facing page, let's say, of the whole thing.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:55:01
The second thing is in the cookbook. In the contributing section, we had this onboarding mentors page and this is geared towards like how you contribute to the cookbook.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:55:16
But also how you contribute to the sort of mentor community. So it's a bit more.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:55:24
It's a bit more, the audience is more written to the mentors or to a contributor.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:55:30
So the purpose of this community is to to get to know each other, work on these things together. You know, this mentor schedule links back to that pretty high level schedule, which has evolved as we've used it so maybe that's less important now.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:55:45
But then it's also kind of a list of like. The tooling we use, this is a reminder of like where they might look to find things.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:55:56
Google Drive, GitHub organization, and then just a little bit of background. So that's what's here now.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:03
Again, this is like, sort of like so mentors have a little bit of an of an orientation and this is maybe what we would.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:12
Originally, this is what Like I would have walked through to make sure I had added.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:20
The right people to the Google Drive and to the GitHub orientation. So this is kind of like a high level like.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:26
Task list for me. And what I've done, What I've been doing now is trying to update.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:35
The approach guide. With some more mentor information. And this is a pull request, but I actually wonder if it's better to just look at it.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:47
Locally. So, okay, okay, so let me just. Open this on a tab here.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:56:59
So this is. You know, we added the mentors framework to the, to the approach that we have more of like a champion, like, like we've done for the champions program where it's like email.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:57:09
Examples and agendas and like more of a checklist so that this can emerge here so that This is for us.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:57:16
This is our. Behind the scenes checklist for what we want to do. There's like you know, this is very much work in progress.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:57:27
There's like no preamble or anything and the check this spreadsheet might not be the first thing we do, but these are some of the things that I just wanted to get down.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:57:33
Because right now what I am doing is updating. The email addresses of who. Is gonna be joining us with the NASA mentors so that I can get their GitHub names and then.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:57:50
Well, so that I can add them in the calendar invites, meet them with one on calls and then kind of have these other places that we add them.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:58:00
You can see I don't even have GitHub or, the Jupiter.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:58:06
Hub like adding them to these places as activities. So It's gonna worry I'm so far I think like these 3 places have 3 different audiences and purposes and Not a lot of redundancy.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:58:20
So it feels good to me and. I guess I would I would think. Too, maybe as I say this allowed.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:58:26
You know, maybe the Jupiter Hub stuff.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:58:31
Is mentioned here, like if you're using added here, but this will not. I'm not thinking of this as being specific to NASA.

[Julia Lowndes] 14:58:40
This is more of like. Generic. Building that. We can use Like I'd like to write this so it's useful for NOAA as we go.
