During Cohort Calls we teach from the slides and not from the book chapters; the chapters will ultimately be a stand-alone resource for self-paced learning (this is a work in progress).\n\nEach lesson is a 10-15 minute slide deck or demo, and there are two lessons per Cohort Call. Lessons are taught followed by an activity so particpants can reflect how topics apply to their own work (see more about [agenda structure](/champions/pre-cohort-tech.html#agenda-structure)). \n\n## Lessons Review\n\nWe review our planned lessons before we teach. We add relevant updates and links; there are new examples and features that we add! It's a balance of adding these to slides or book chapters so that the slides have up-to-date information but aren't too overwhelming.\n\nWe also invite guest teachers, and offer to pay them for their time. \n\n## Lesson Planning\n\nWe'll be collaborating to develop new lessons with partners for our four-month cohorts! We do this with a spreadsheet to plan lessons and implement them closer to teaching dates so that we can be responsive to cohort needs. Planning includes topics, slide decks, activities, efficiency tips, and Seaside Chat topics. More here soon.\n\n- Example: [SASI Cohort Lesson Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nYS_EDhddmG3ILwqmO432tUsjjshlhHnxuoSM4r2cs4/edit#gid=0)\n\nNew lessons will build from the core lessons we lead for two-month cohorts (from the [Series welcome](https://openscapes.github.io/series/)):\n\n\nCohort Call Agendas          | Series Chapters |      Between Cohort Calls\n------------------|----------------------|---------------------------\n[1.
