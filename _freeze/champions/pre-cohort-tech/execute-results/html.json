Some things we do before the first Cohort Call (i.e. Google Folder) and some after the first Cohort Call (i.e. Slack). We'll schedule GitHub Clinics prior to the second Cohort Call.\n\n*Note: we are working to automate our tech setup for each cohort 😍 This work will eventually be in an `openscapesr` R package, stay tuned.*\n\n## GitHub repo\n\nPrior to the GitHub Clinic, we:\n\n-   Create a Cohort GitHub repo within the Openscapes GitHub organization.\n-   Make it a website repo: Settings > Pages > Source: main, dir: root\n-   Add our Code of Coduct\n-   Write Cohort info on the README\n-   *Add Evaluation information*\n\nExample: <https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-noaa-nmfs>\n\n### For the GitHub Clinic:\n\nBefore the GitHub Clinic, we:\n\n-   Add all usernames with admin privileges\n-   Create each person's files\n\nWe'll need to ask people to create a GitHub account and share their username with us - part of Data Entry up next. \n\n#### Temporary hacky approach for adding files to the repo for the GitHub Clinic: \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(datapasta) # install.packages(\"datapasta\")\n# restart RStudio Session: click on the repo name top right, click on the name of the repo\n\nfile_in <-  \"gh-clinic-text.md\"\ntext_template <- read_lines(file_in)\n\n## use `datapasta` addin to vector_paste these names formatted from the spreadsheet!\ncohort <-c(\"Ameya\", \"Amy\", \"Andrea\", \"Anthony\", \"Chris\", \"Daniel\", \"Danyel\", \"Duran\", \"Ellysa\", \n           \"Gabrielle\", \"Hu\", \"Jonathan\", \"Julia\", \"Kathyn\", \"Kelly\", \"Madeline\", \"Maria_t\", \"Maria_r\", \"Megan\", \n           \"Nicole\", \"Nidal\", \"Nipam\", \"Sittman\", \"Sophia\", \"Srikari\", \"Swapna\", \"Syrena\", \"Yixian\")\n## check by hand that there are no dupicates and if so, underscore with last name intitial\ncohort <- str_to_lower(cohort)\n\nsetwd(\"github-clinic\")\n\nfor (champion in cohort) {\n  \n  file_out <- glue::glue(champion, \".md\")\n  text_write <- write_lines(text_template, file_out)\n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data entry\n\nAs teams form, we:\n\n-   Update database with who is in which cohort, whether we've added them to the calendars and twitter, etc.\n\nMore details upcoming: Airtable\n\n## Cohort Google Folder\n\nPrior to the first Cohort Call, we:\n\n-   Create a Google Folder with the name of the cohort in brackets, e.g. `[ 2021-noaa-nmfs ]`\n-   Add all Cohort emails (note: some participants will provide a gmail address if their univerity email isn't gmail; add this address as well)\n-   Add a Pathways folder\n\n## Agendas {#agenda-setup}\n\n[Blank agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1II5YXUK_iuV7fXelcUV49RPAXxI7fveJ?usp=sharing) are in a public Google Folder. Before each Cohort Call, we:\n\n-   Make a copy\n-   Save it in the Cohort Google Folder\n-   Edit dates, times, add Google Folder links and Zoom links\n-   Review and tailor for Cohort and Facilitator (including Land Acknowledgement)\n\nWe usually do this before each Cohort Call (as opposed to all at once at the beginning) as a way for us to review/prepare for each Cohort Call and so to reduce confusion for participants. See\n\n### Agenda structure {#agenda-structure}\n\nCohort Calls are 1 hour 30 minutes. Each Call is different, but they have this core structure:\n\n-   Roll call with ice breaker\n-   Welcome with Code of Conduct reminder\n-   Lesson with activity 1\n-   Lesson with activity 2\n-   Efficiency tip\n\nActivities include prompted silent journaling or breakout groups followed by group discussion. Breakout groups are 3-4 people each; some are random, some group by team, and some group leads together and members together.\n\n## Slack\n\nAfter the first Cohort Call, we:\n\n-   Create a private Slack channel for the cohort Invite everyone to Slack\n",
