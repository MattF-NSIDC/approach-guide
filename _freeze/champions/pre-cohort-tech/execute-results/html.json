Most things we do before the first Cohort Call (i.e. Google Folder) and some after the first Cohort Call (i.e. Slack). We review Cohort Agendas before each Cohort and make minor adjustments before each call.  \n\n*Note: we are working to automate our tech setup for each cohort üòç This work will eventually be in the `kyber` R package, stay tuned.*\n\n## Cohort Registry\n\nReview the [Cohort Registry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oej46BMX_SLIc1cwoyLHzNWwGlT3szez8FDKc3b418w/edit#gid=695033382) Google Doc and update information for the new Cohort. *make this public once it's tidied and stable*. This will be iterative as you create the Cohort Google Drive Folder and GitHub repo (see below).\n\n## cohort-planning Issue\n\nCreate an issue <https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues> to keep track of links and tag other co-leads and assists. We're using GitHub teams.\n\n## Cohort Google Folder\n\n-   Create a Google Folder with the name of the cohort in brackets, e.g. `[ 2021-noaa-nmfs ]`\n-   Add a Pathways folder and add a shortcut for the [Pathways Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X_-qPdWDCpw2F3nZr6vZnq87guyUIGLvekm0XV2H-A8/edit#gid=0)\n\n## Data entry\n\nAs teams form, we:\n\n-   Update database with who is in which cohort, whether we've added them to the calendars and twitter, etc.\n-   Google Folder Permission: Add all Cohort emails (note: some participants will provide a gmail address if their university email isn't gmail; add this address as well)\n\n## Agenda setup {#agenda-setup}\n\n[Blank agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1II5YXUK_iuV7fXelcUV49RPAXxI7fveJ?usp=sharing) are in a public Google Folder. Before each Cohort Call, we:\n\n-   Make a copy\n-   Save it in the Cohort Google Folder\n-   Edit dates, times, add Google Folder links and Zoom links\n-   Review and tailor for Cohort and Facilitator (including Land Acknowledgement)\n\nWe usually do this before each Cohort Call (as opposed to all at once at the beginning) as a way for us to review/prepare for each Cohort Call and so to reduce confusion for participants.\n\n## GitHub repo \n\n-   Create a Cohort GitHub repo within the Openscapes GitHub organization.\n-   Make it a website repo: Settings > Pages > Source: main, dir: root\n-   Add our Code of Coduct\n-   Write Cohort info on the README\n-   *Add Evaluation information*\n\nExample: <https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-noaa-nmfs>\n\n\n### For the GitHub Clinic:\n\nBefore the GitHub Clinic, we:\n\n- Add all usernames with member privileges to a GitHub Team titled `2022-noaa-afsc-teams`\n- Give the Team access to the Cohort repo\n- Create each person's files\n\nWe'll need to ask people to create a GitHub account and share their username with us - part of Data Entry up next. \n\n#### Temporary hacky approach for adding files to the repo for the GitHub Clinic: \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(datapasta) # install.packages(\"datapasta\")\n# restart RStudio Session: click on the repo name top right, click on the name of the repo\n\nfile_in <-  \"gh-clinic-text.md\"\ntext_template <- read_lines(file_in)\n\n## use `datapasta` addin to vector_paste these names formatted from the spreadsheet!\ncohort <-c(\"Ameya\", \"Amy\", \"Andrea\", \"Anthony\", \"Chris\", \"Daniel\", \"Danyel\", \"Duran\", \"Ellysa\", \n           \"Gabrielle\", \"Hu\", \"Jonathan\", \"Julia\", \"Kathyn\", \"Kelly\", \"Madeline\", \"Maria_t\", \"Maria_r\", \"Megan\", \n           \"Nicole\", \"Nidal\", \"Nipam\", \"Sittman\", \"Sophia\", \"Srikari\", \"Swapna\", \"Syrena\", \"Yixian\")\n## check by hand that there are no dupicates and if so, underscore with last name intitial\ncohort <- str_to_lower(cohort)\n\nsetwd(\"github-clinic\")\n\nfor (champion in cohort) {\n  \n  file_out <- glue::glue(champion, \".md\")\n  text_write <- write_lines(text_template, file_out)\n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n### Leading GitHub Clinics\n\n- add Openscapes Team as co-hosts\n\n\n\n\n## Slack\n\nAfter the first Cohort Call, we:\n\n-   Create a private Slack channel for the cohort Invite everyone to Slack\n",
