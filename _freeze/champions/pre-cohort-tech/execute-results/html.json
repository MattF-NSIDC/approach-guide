Most things we do before the first Cohort Call (i.e. Google Folder) and some after the first Cohort Call (i.e. Slack). We review Cohort Agendas before each Cohort and make minor adjustments before each call.  \n\n*Note: we are working to automate our tech setup for each cohort üòç This work will eventually be in the `kyber` R package, stay tuned.*\n\n## GitHub Issues\n\nWe use the <https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues> repository to track collective TODO's as well as to have \"quick links\" available before each Cohort Call. This repository coordinates across cohorts, so it's best to \"unwatch\" except when you're tagged and then we tag each issue with the folks involved. We're using GitHub teams to group folks involved in each cohort and easily tag them. This way, we can all learn and coordinate across cohorts when we want to poke through the issues but aren't cluttered with emails. \n\nTwo starting Issues to make: \n\n- \"Quicklinks\" Issue with links nice to have open during Cohort Calls. Example: [2022-nmfs-afsc](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues/47). We pin this issue so that it shows up at the top of  <https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues>\n- \"Pre-cohort setup: Issue with check-boxes aligned with this approach-guide so we know what's been done. Aligning this Issue with the approach-guide is a work-in-progress. Example: [2022-nmfs-afsc](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues/48) \n\n## Cohort Google Folder\n\n-   Create a Google Folder with the name of the cohort in brackets, e.g. `[ 2021-noaa-nmfs ]`\n-   Add a Pathways folder and add a shortcut for the [Pathways Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X_-qPdWDCpw2F3nZr6vZnq87guyUIGLvekm0XV2H-A8/edit#gid=0)\n\nWe'll add Agendas here the days before each Cohort Call, and will add participants to this Google Folder prior to Call 1.\n\n## Cohort Registry\n\nReview the [Cohort Registry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oej46BMX_SLIc1cwoyLHzNWwGlT3szez8FDKc3b418w/edit#gid=695033382) Google Doc and update information for the new Cohort. *make this public once it's tidied and stable and describe its use for `kyber`*. \n\n## Data entry\n\nAs teams form, we:\n\n-   Update database with who is in which cohort\n-   Google Folder Permission: Add all Cohort emails (note: some participants will provide a gmail address if their university email isn't gmail; add this address as well)\n\n\n## GitHub repo \n\n-   Create a Cohort GitHub repo within the Openscapes GitHub organization.\n-   Make it a website repo: Settings > Pages > Source: main, dir: root\n-   Add our Code of Coduct\n-   Write Cohort info on the README\n-   *Add Evaluation information*\n\nExample: <https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-noaa-nmfs>\n\n\n### For the GitHub Clinic:\n\nBefore the GitHub Clinic, we:\n\n- Add all usernames with member privileges to a GitHub Team titled `2022-noaa-afsc-teams`\n- Give the Team access to the Cohort repo\n- Create each person's files\n\nWe'll need to ask people to create a GitHub account and share their username with us - part of Data Entry up next. \n\n#### Temporary hacky approach for adding files to the repo for the GitHub Clinic: \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(datapasta) # install.packages(\"datapasta\")\n# restart RStudio Session: click on the repo name top right, click on the name of the repo\n\nfile_in <-  \"gh-clinic-text.md\"\ntext_template <- read_lines(file_in)\n\n## use `datapasta` addin to vector_paste these names formatted from the spreadsheet!\ncohort <-c(\"Ameya\", \"Amy\", \"Andrea\", \"Anthony\", \"Chris\", \"Daniel\", \"Danyel\", \"Duran\", \"Ellysa\", \n           \"Gabrielle\", \"Hu\", \"Jonathan\", \"Julia\", \"Kathyn\", \"Kelly\", \"Madeline\", \"Maria_t\", \"Maria_r\", \"Megan\", \n           \"Nicole\", \"Nidal\", \"Nipam\", \"Sittman\", \"Sophia\", \"Srikari\", \"Swapna\", \"Syrena\", \"Yixian\")\n## check by hand that there are no dupicates and if so, underscore with last name intitial\ncohort <- str_to_lower(cohort)\n\nsetwd(\"github-clinic\")\n\nfor (champion in cohort) {\n  \n  file_out <- glue::glue(champion, \".md\")\n  text_write <- write_lines(text_template, file_out)\n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n### Leading GitHub Clinics\n\n- add Openscapes Team as co-hosts\n\n\n## Slack\n\nAfter the first Cohort Call, we:\n\n-   Create a private Slack channel for the cohort Invite everyone to Slack\n",
