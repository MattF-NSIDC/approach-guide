We work towards **kinder science.**\n\nWe approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. There are many ways to practice open science and to welcome others to participate. We see data analysis and stewardship as powerful entryways for open science, and we meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skillsets and mindsets of immediate value while empowering them as leaders. We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate justice and get out the vote movements.\n\n## Openscapes Mindset and practice\n\nThe Openscapes Mindset is about moving away from lonely, individual science and towards science that is more efficient, open, collaborative, inclusive and kind. We describe this for research teams in the [Champions Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/). This mindset also drives how we lead Openscapes as a program and an approach, as described below.\n\n\n### We work openly and for Future Us.\n\nWe use the same tooling to lead Openscapes that are powerful for research: based in R (RMarkdown, Quarto), GitHub, Google Drive, and Twitter. We share imperfect work and work in progress openly. Some examples of this are this Approach Guide, the Lesson Series, as well as our [how-we-work Openscapes Planning GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/Openscapes/projects/5). We also have open learning conversations through our Community Calls. \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.out=\"10%\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/betterscience-future-us-sortee.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGrowth Mindset. \n\nContinual learning â€” and practicing and iterating with that learning.\n\nPsychological safety ([Edmundson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8)).\n\nKinder science. \n\nWe use the same open source tools that teach.\n\n",
