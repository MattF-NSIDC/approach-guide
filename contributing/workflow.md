title: "Workflow"

Here we will be using the RStudio IDE rather than the command line; please also see <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/workflow.html> as we develop this further. 

## Overview

- We'll use GitHub branches, consider them temporary and unlimited
- We'll interact with Quarto through RStudio

## Create a branch on GitHub.com

1. Go to <https://github.com/Openscapes/approach-guide> click the `main` branch and type `your-branch` name for your branch
1. Clone/pull <https://github.com/Openscapes/approach-guide> locally to RStudio
1. Click in the top-right on `main` and switch to `your-branch`; this will add it to the "local branches" section.
